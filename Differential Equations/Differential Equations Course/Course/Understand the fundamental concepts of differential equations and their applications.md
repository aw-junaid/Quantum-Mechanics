### **1. Fundamental Concepts of Differential Equations**

#### **1.1 Definition and Classification**
   - **Differential Equation (DE)**: An equation involving derivatives of one or more dependent variables with respect to one or more independent variables.
   - **Types of Differential Equations**:
     - **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**: Equations involving derivatives of a function of a single variable.
     - **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**: Equations involving partial derivatives of a function of multiple variables.
   - **Order**: The highest derivative present in the equation.
   - **Linearity**: A differential equation is linear if the dependent variable and its derivatives appear linearly (e.g., no products or nonlinear functions).

#### **1.2 Solutions of Differential Equations**
   - **General Solution**: A family of solutions containing arbitrary constants.
   - **Particular Solution**: A specific solution obtained by assigning values to the arbitrary constants.
   - **Singular Solution**: A solution that cannot be obtained from the general solution.
   - **Initial Value Problems (IVPs)**: Problems where the solution satisfies specific initial conditions.
   - **Boundary Value Problems (BVPs)**: Problems where the solution satisfies conditions at different points.

#### **1.3 Direction Fields and Qualitative Analysis**
   - **Direction Fields**: Graphical representations of solutions to first-order ODEs, showing the slope of the solution at various points.
   - **Qualitative Analysis**: Understanding the behavior of solutions without explicitly solving the equation (e.g., stability, long-term behavior).
