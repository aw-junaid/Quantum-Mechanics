**Vector spaces** are fundamental structures in linear algebra that generalize the concept of vectors in Euclidean space. They provide a framework for studying linear combinations, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. Vector spaces are widely used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Definition of a Vector Space**

A **vector space** $\( V \) over a field \( \mathbb{F} \) (usually \( \mathbb{R} \) or \( \mathbb{C} \))$ is a set of objects called **vectors**, together with two operations:
1. **Vector addition**: Combines two vectors $\( \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in V \) to produce another vector \( \vec{u} + \vec{v} \in V \)$.
2. **Scalar multiplication**: Combines a scalar $\( c \in \mathbb{F} \) and a vector \( \vec{u} \in V \) to produce another vector \( c \vec{u} \in V \)$.

These operations must satisfy the following axioms for all $\( \vec{u}, \vec{v}, \vec{w} \in V \) and \( c, d \in \mathbb{F} \)$:
1. **Commutativity**: $\( \vec{u} + \vec{v} = \vec{v} + \vec{u} \)$.
2. **Associativity**: $\( (\vec{u} + \vec{v}) + \vec{w} = \vec{u} + (\vec{v} + \vec{w}) \)$.
3. **Additive identity**: There exists a vector $\( \vec{0} \in V \) such that \( \vec{u} + \vec{0} = \vec{u} \)$.
4. **Additive inverse**: For every $\( \vec{u} \in V \), there exists \( -\vec{u} \in V \) such that \( \vec{u} + (-\vec{u}) = \vec{0} \)$.
5. **Distributivity**: $\( c (\vec{u} + \vec{v}) = c \vec{u} + c \vec{v} \) and \( (c + d) \vec{u} = c \vec{u} + d \vec{u} \)$.
6. **Scalar multiplication identity**: $\( 1 \vec{u} = \vec{u} \)$.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Subspaces**:
   - A subset $\( W \subseteq V \)$ is a **subspace** if it is itself a vector space under the operations of \( V \).

2. **Linear Independence**:
   - A set of vectors $\( \{ \vec{v}_1, \vec{v}_2, \dots, \vec{v}_n \} \)$ is **linearly independent** if the only solution to $\( c_1 \vec{v}_1 + c_2 \vec{v}_2 + \dots + c_n \vec{v}_n = \vec{0} \) is \( c_1 = c_2 = \dots = c_n = 0 \)$.

3. **Basis**:
   - A **basis** of \( V \) is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans \( V \).
   - The **dimension** of \( V \) is the number of vectors in a basis.

4. **Linear Transformations**:
   - A function $\( T: V \to W \)$ between vector spaces is **linear** if:
     $\[
     T(c \vec{u} + d \vec{v}) = c T(\vec{u}) + d T(\vec{v}).
     \]$

5. **Inner Product Spaces**:
   - A vector space equipped with an **inner product** $\( \langle \vec{u}, \vec{v} \rangle \)$ is called an **inner product space**.
   - The inner product generalizes the dot product in Euclidean space.

### **Examples of Vector Spaces**

1. **Euclidean Space**:
   - $\( \mathbb{R}^n \)$: The set of all \( n \)-tuples of real numbers with component-wise addition and scalar multiplication.

2. **Function Spaces**:
   - The set of all continuous functions $\( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \)$ is a vector space.

3. **Polynomial Spaces**:
   - The set of all polynomials of degree $\( \leq n \)$ is a vector space.

4. **Matrix Spaces**:
   - The set of all $\( m \times n \)$ matrices is a vector space.

### **Applications of Vector Spaces**

1. **Physics**:
   - Describes states in quantum mechanics and solutions to differential equations.

2. **Engineering**:
   - Analyzes systems of linear equations and control systems.

3. **Computer Science**:
   - Represents data in machine learning and computer graphics.

4. **Economics**:
   - Models optimization problems and resource allocation.

### **Example Problems**

1. **Determine if $\( W = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x + y + z = 0 \} \)$ is a subspace of $\( \mathbb{R}^3 \)$**:
   - Check if \( W \) is closed under addition and scalar multiplication:
     - Let $\( \vec{u} = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \)$ and $\( \vec{v} = (x_2, y_2, z_2) \)$ be in \( W \). Then:
       $\[
       x_1 + y_1 + z_1 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 + y_2 + z_2 = 0.
       \]$
     - For $\( \vec{u} + \vec{v} = (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2, z_1 + z_2) \)$:
       $\[
       (x_1 + x_2) + (y_1 + y_2) + (z_1 + z_2) = (x_1 + y_1 + z_1) + (x_2 + y_2 + z_2) = 0 + 0 = 0.
       \]$
     - For $\( c \vec{u} = (c x_1, c y_1, c z_1) \)$:
       $\[
       c x_1 + c y_1 + c z_1 = c (x_1 + y_1 + z_1) = c \cdot 0 = 0.
       \]$
   - Since \( W \) is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, it is a subspace.

2. **Find a basis for the subspace $\( W = \{ (x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x + y + z = 0 \} \)$**:
   - Express \( z \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
     $\[
     z = -x - y.
     \]$
   - A general vector in \( W \) is:
     $\[
     (x, y, -x - y) = x (1, 0, -1) + y (0, 1, -1).
     \]$
   - The vectors \( (1, 0, -1) \) and \( (0, 1, -1) \) are linearly independent and span \( W \).
   - A basis for \( W \) is:
     $\[
     \{ (1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1) \}.
     \]$

3. **Determine if the set $\( \{ \vec{v}_1 = (1, 2), \vec{v}_2 = (3, 4) \} \)$ is a basis for $\( \mathbb{R}^2 \)$**:
   - Check if the vectors are linearly independent:
     - Solve $\( c_1 (1, 2) + c_2 (3, 4) = (0, 0) \)$:
       $\[
       c_1 + 3 c_2 = 0, \quad 2 c_1 + 4 c_2 = 0.
       \]$
       The only solution is $\( c_1 = c_2 = 0 \)$, so the vectors are linearly independent.
   - Since $\( \mathbb{R}^2 \)$ has dimension 2, the set is a basis.

4. **Find the dimension of the vector space of all $\( 2 \times 2 \)$ symmetric matrices**:
   - A symmetric matrix has the form:
```math
     \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ b & c \end{bmatrix}.
```
   - The matrices:
```math
     \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
```
     are linearly independent and span the space of symmetric matrices.
   - The dimension is 3.
