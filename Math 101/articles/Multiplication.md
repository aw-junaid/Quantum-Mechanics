### **Multiplication: The Concept of Repeated Addition**  

**Multiplication** is a fundamental arithmetic operation that represents repeated addition. It is used to find the total when one number is taken multiple times.

### **Basic Concept of Multiplication**  
- **Symbol:** The multiplication sign **( × )**, **( * )**, or **( · )**  
- **Formula:**  
  $\[
  a \times b = c
  \] $ 
  where:  
  - **a** is the multiplicand (the number being multiplied).  
  - **b** is the multiplier (the number of times **a** is taken).  
  - **c** is the product (the result).  

**Example:**  
$\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\] $ 
(Here, **3** is taken **4** times, resulting in **12**.)

### **Properties of Multiplication**  

1. **Commutative Property** (Order Doesn’t Matter)  
   $\[
   a \times b = b \times a
   \]$  
   Example:  
   $\[
   6 \times 3 = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \] $ 

2. **Associative Property** (Grouping Doesn’t Matter)  
   $\[
   (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)
   \] $ 
   Example:  
   $\[
   (2 \times 3) \times 4 = 2 \times (3 \times 4) = 24
   \] $ 

3. **Distributive Property** (Multiplying Over Addition)  
   $\[
   a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)
   \] $ 
   Example:  
   $\[
   5 \times (3 + 2) = (5 \times 3) + (5 \times 2) = 15 + 10 = 25
   \] $ 

4. **Identity Property** (Multiplication by 1)  
   - Any number multiplied by **1** remains unchanged.  
   - Example:  
     $\[
     7 \times 1 = 7
     \]$  

5. **Zero Property** (Multiplication by 0)  
   - Any number multiplied by **0** is always **0**.  
   - Example:  
     $\[
     9 \times 0 = 0
     \]$

### **Types of Multiplication**  

1. **Repeated Addition**  
   - Example:  
     $\[
     4 \times 3 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
     \]$ 

2. **Column Multiplication (Long Multiplication)**  
   - Used for multiplying multi-digit numbers.  
   - Example:  
     ```
       23
     ×  5
     -----
      115
     ```  

3. **Multiplying Negative Numbers**  
   - **Positive × Positive = Positive**  
     $\[
     4 \times 3 = 12
     \]$  
   - **Positive × Negative = Negative**  
     $\[
     4 \times (-3) = -12
     \] $ 
   - **Negative × Negative = Positive**  
     $\[
     (-4) \times (-3) = 12
     \]$  

4. **Multiplying Fractions**  
   - Multiply numerators and denominators.  
   - Example:  
     $\[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{8}{15}
     \]$  

5. **Multiplying Decimals**  
   - Ignore decimal points, multiply normally, then place the decimal back.  
   - Example:  
     ```
       2.5
     ×  1.2
     ------
       3.00
     ```

6. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   - Used in advanced math, physics, and computer science.  
   - Follows row-by-column dot product rules.  

7. **Vector Multiplication**  
   - **Dot Product:** Produces a scalar value.  
   - **Cross Product:** Produces a vector.
