### **Negative Numbers: Understanding and Operations**  

Negative numbers are numbers **less than zero**. They are written with a **minus (-) sign** and represent values **below zero**, such as temperatures, debts, and elevations below sea level.

## **1. Number Line Representation**  

A **number line** helps visualize negative numbers:  

```
... -4  -3  -2  -1  0  1  2  3  4 ...
```

- Numbers **increase** as you move **right**.  
- Numbers **decrease** as you move **left**.  
- **0** is neither positive nor negative.

## **2. Operations with Negative Numbers**  

### **A. Addition of Negative Numbers**  
1. **Same signs:** Add their absolute values and keep the sign.  
   - Example: **(-3) + (-2) = -5**  
2. **Different signs:** Subtract smaller absolute value from the larger one and keep the sign of the larger.  
   - Example: **(-5) + (3) = -2**  

---

### **B. Subtraction of Negative Numbers**  
**Rule:** Subtracting a negative number is the same as **adding its positive**.  

\[
a - (-b) = a + b
\]

- Example: **5 - (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7**  
- Example: **-3 - (-6) = -3 + 6 = 3**  

---

### **C. Multiplication of Negative Numbers**  
1. **Positive × Positive = Positive**  
   - Example: **3 × 2 = 6**  
2. **Negative × Negative = Positive**  
   - Example: **(-3) × (-2) = 6**  
3. **Positive × Negative = Negative**  
   - Example: **(3) × (-2) = -6**  
4. **Negative × Positive = Negative**  
   - Example: **(-4) × (5) = -20**  

✔ **Rule of Signs for Multiplication:**  
- **Same signs → Positive**  
- **Different signs → Negative**

### **D. Division of Negative Numbers**  
Division follows the same sign rules as multiplication:  

1. **Positive ÷ Positive = Positive**  
   - Example: **6 ÷ 2 = 3**  
2. **Negative ÷ Negative = Positive**  
   - Example: **(-8) ÷ (-2) = 4**  
3. **Positive ÷ Negative = Negative**  
   - Example: **(12) ÷ (-4) = -3**  
4. **Negative ÷ Positive = Negative**  
   - Example: **(-15) ÷ (5) = -3**  

✔ **Rule of Signs for Division:**  
- **Same signs → Positive**  
- **Different signs → Negative**

## **3. Absolute Value (|x|)**  
The **absolute value** of a number is its **distance from zero** on the number line, **ignoring the sign**.  

- **|5| = 5**  
- **|-5| = 5**  
- **|0| = 0**  

---

## **4. Real-World Applications**  
- **Banking:** Balances and debts (e.g., -$50 means you owe $50).  
- **Temperature:** -10°C is below freezing.  
- **Physics:** Direction of forces (e.g., velocity can be negative for moving backward).  
- **Stock Market:** Negative percentages show losses.  

Understanding **negative numbers** is essential for **math, science, and everyday life!**
