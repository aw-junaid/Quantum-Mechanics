# **Elementary Algebra: Understanding the Basics**  

**Elementary Algebra** is the branch of mathematics that introduces **variables, equations, and expressions** to solve problems. It is essential in **science, engineering, economics, and everyday life**.

## **1. Basics of Algebra**  

### **A. Variables and Constants**  
- **Variable:** A symbol (like \( x \), \( y \)) representing an unknown value.  
- **Constant:** A fixed number (like 2, 5, $\( \pi \))$.  

**Example:**  
$\[
x + 3 = 7
\]$  
Here, **\( x \)** is the variable, and **3, 7** are constants.  

---

### **B. Algebraic Expressions**  
An **expression** is a mathematical phrase **without an equal sign**.  

**Examples:**  
- $\( 3x + 5 \) $ 
- $\( 2a - b^2 \)$ 

---

### **C. Algebraic Equations**  
An **equation** has an **equal sign (=)** and shows a relationship.  

**Examples:**  
- $\( 2x + 3 = 7 \)$  
- $\( y - 5 = 2x \)$  

---

## **2. Solving Algebraic Equations**  

### **A. Solving Linear Equations**  
A **linear equation** has the form:  
$\[
ax + b = 0
\]$  

**Example:** Solve $\( 2x + 3 = 7 \)$.  

**Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides.  
$\[
2x = 4
\]$  

**Step 2:** Divide by 2.  
$\[
x = 2
\]$  

---

### **B. Solving Quadratic Equations**  
A **quadratic equation** has the form:  
$\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]$  

**Example:** Solve $\( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \)$.  

**Step 1:** Factor the equation.  
$\[
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
\]$  

**Step 2:** Solve for \( x \).  
$\[
x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
\]$

$\[
x = 2, \quad x = 3
\]$

## **3. Algebraic Properties**  

| **Property** | **Example** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Commutative** (Order doesn’t matter) | $\( a + b = b + a \)$ |
| **Associative** (Grouping doesn’t matter) | $\( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \)$ |
| **Distributive** (Expanding brackets) | $\( a(b + c) = ab + ac \)$ |

## **4. Applications of Algebra**  
- **Finance**: Calculating interest.  
- **Physics**: Motion equations $(\( s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^2 \))$.  
- **Computer Science**: Algorithm development.  
- **Medicine**: Drug dosage calculations.

### **Conclusion**  
**Elementary Algebra** is the foundation of advanced math and real-world problem-solving. Mastering it helps in **technology, science, and everyday life**.
