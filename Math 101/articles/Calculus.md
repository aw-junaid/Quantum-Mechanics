Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies continuous change. It is divided into two main areas: **differential calculus** and **integral calculus**. Calculus is fundamental to science, engineering, economics, and many other fields. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Key Concepts in Calculus**

1. **Differential Calculus**:
   - Focuses on the concept of the **derivative**, which measures how a function changes as its input changes.
   - Used to find rates of change, slopes of curves, and optimize functions.

2. **Integral Calculus**:
   - Focuses on the concept of the **integral**, which measures the accumulation of quantities (e.g., area under a curve).
   - Used to compute areas, volumes, and solve problems involving accumulation.

3. **Limits**:
   - The foundation of calculus. A limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point.
   - Notation: $\( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \)$.

### **Differential Calculus**

1. **Derivative**:
   - The derivative of a function $\( f(x) \)$ with respect to \( x \) is denoted as $\( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{df}{dx} \)$.
   - Represents the instantaneous rate of change of \( f(x) \) at a point.
   - Definition:
     $\[
     f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
     \]$

2. **Rules of Differentiation**:
   - **Power Rule**: $\( \frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1} \)$.
   - **Product Rule**: $\( \frac{d}{dx} [u(x)v(x)] = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) \)$.
   - **Quotient Rule**: $\( \frac{d}{dx} \left[\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\right] = \frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{v(x)^2} \)$.
   - **Chain Rule**: $\( \frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \)$.

3. **Applications of Derivatives**:
   - Finding slopes of tangent lines to curves.
   - Determining rates of change (e.g., velocity, acceleration).
   - Optimizing functions (e.g., finding maxima and minima).

### **Integral Calculus**

1. **Integral**:
   - The integral of a function \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is denoted as $\( \int f(x) \, dx \)$.
   - Represents the accumulation of quantities (e.g., area under a curve).
   - **Definite Integral**: Computes the accumulation over an interval $\([a, b]\)$:
     $\[
     \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
     \]$
   - **Indefinite Integral**: Represents a family of functions (antiderivatives):
     $\[
     \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
     \]$
     where $\( F'(x) = f(x) \)$ and \( C \) is the constant of integration.

2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:
   - Connects differentiation and integration:
     $\[
     \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
     \]$
     where $\( F(x) \)$ is an antiderivative of $\( f(x) \)$.

3. **Techniques of Integration**:
   - **Substitution**: Used to simplify integrals by changing variables.
   - **Integration by Parts**: Based on the product rule:
     $\[
     \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
     \]$
   - **Partial Fractions**: Decomposes rational functions into simpler fractions.

4. **Applications of Integrals**:
   - Computing areas under curves.
   - Finding volumes of solids of revolution.
   - Solving problems involving accumulation (e.g., total distance traveled).

### **Multivariable Calculus**

1. **Partial Derivatives**:
   - Used for functions of multiple variables. The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is denoted as \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \).

2. **Multiple Integrals**:
   - Extends integration to functions of multiple variables (e.g., double integrals for areas, triple integrals for volumes).

3. **Vector Calculus**:
   - Studies vector fields, line integrals, and surface integrals.

### **Applications of Calculus**

1. **Physics**:
   - Describes motion, forces, and energy using derivatives and integrals.

2. **Engineering**:
   - Used to design systems, analyze signals, and optimize processes.

3. **Economics**:
   - Models growth, optimization, and resource allocation.

4. **Biology**:
   - Describes population dynamics and biological processes.

5. **Computer Science**:
   - Used in machine learning, graphics, and algorithms.

### **Example Problems**

1. **Find the derivative of $\( f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 \)$**:
   $\[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(3x^2) + \frac{d}{dx}(2x) - \frac{d}{dx}(5) = 6x + 2.
   \]$

2. **Compute the integral $\( \int (4x^3 + 2x) \, dx \)$**:
   $\[
   \int (4x^3 + 2x) \, dx = x^4 + x^2 + C.
   \]$

3. **Find the area under the curve $\( y = x^2 \)$ from $\( x = 0 \) to \( x = 2 \)$**:
   $\[
   \int_0^2 x^2 \, dx = \left[\frac{x^3}{3}\right]_0^2 = \frac{8}{3}.
   \]$

4. **Solve the differential equation $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 \)$**:
   $\[
   y = \int 3x^2 \, dx = x^3 + C.
   \]$
