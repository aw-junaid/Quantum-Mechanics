**Partial differential equations (PDEs)** are equations that involve partial derivatives of a function of multiple variables. They are used to model phenomena in physics, engineering, and other sciences where quantities vary in space and time. PDEs are more complex than ordinary differential equations (ODEs) because they involve multiple independent variables. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Key Concepts in PDEs**

1. **Order of a PDE**:
   - The highest order of the partial derivatives in the equation.
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0 \)$ is a second-order PDE.

2. **Linearity**:
   - A PDE is linear if the dependent variable and its partial derivatives appear linearly (no products or powers).
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \) is linear; \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 \)$ is nonlinear.

3. **Types of PDEs**:
   - **Elliptic PDEs**: Describe steady-state phenomena (e.g., Laplace's equation).
   - **Parabolic PDEs**: Describe diffusion processes (e.g., heat equation).
   - **Hyperbolic PDEs**: Describe wave propagation (e.g., wave equation).

### **Common PDEs and Their Applications**

1. **Laplace's Equation**:
   - $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0 \)$.
   - Describes steady-state heat distribution, electrostatics, and fluid flow.

2. **Heat Equation**:
   - $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.
   - Models heat conduction and diffusion.

3. **Wave Equation**:
   - $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.
   - Describes wave propagation, such as sound and light waves.

4. **Schr√∂dinger Equation**:
   - $\( i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V \psi \)$.
   - Models quantum mechanical systems.

### **Solving PDEs**

1. **Separation of Variables**:
   - Assume a solution of the form $\( u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) \)$ and substitute into the PDE to separate variables.
   - Example: Solve the heat equation $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$:
     - Assume $\( u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) \)$.
     - Substitute into the PDE:
       $\[
       X(x) T'(t) = k X''(x) T(t).
       \]$
     - Separate variables:
       $\[
       \frac{T'(t)}{k T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\lambda.
       \]$
     - Solve the resulting ODEs for $\( X(x) \) and \( T(t) \)$.

2. **Fourier Transform**:
   - Converts a PDE into an ODE in the frequency domain.
   - Example: Solve the heat equation $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$:
     - Take the Fourier transform of both sides:
       $\[
       \frac{\partial \hat{u}}{\partial t} = -k \xi^2 \hat{u}.
       \]$
     - Solve the ODE for $\( \hat{u}(\xi, t) \)$:
       $\[
       \hat{u}(\xi, t) = \hat{u}(\xi, 0) e^{-k \xi^2 t}.
       \]$
     - Take the inverse Fourier transform to find $\( u(x, t) \)$.

3. **Laplace Transform**:
   - Converts a PDE into an ODE in the Laplace domain.
   - Example: Solve the wave equation $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$:
     - Take the Laplace transform of both sides:
       $\[
       s^2 U(x, s) - s u(x, 0) - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, 0) = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2}.
       \]$
     - Solve the ODE for $\( U(x, s) \)$:
       $\[
       \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} - \frac{s^2}{c^2} U = -\frac{s}{c^2} u(x, 0) - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, 0).
       \]$
     - Take the inverse Laplace transform to find $\( u(x, t) \)$.

4. **Numerical Methods**:
   - Finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods are used to approximate solutions to PDEs.

### **Example Problems**

1. **Solve the heat equation $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$ with boundary conditions $\( u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 \)$ and initial condition $\( u(x, 0) = f(x) \)$**:
   - Assume $\( u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) \)$.
   - Separate variables:
     $\[
     \frac{T'(t)}{k T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\lambda.
     \]$
   - Solve the ODE for $\( X(x) \)$:
     $\[
     X''(x) + \lambda X(x) = 0, \quad X(0) = X(L) = 0.
     \]$
     The solutions are $\( X_n(x) = \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right) \) with \( \lambda_n = \left( \frac{n \pi}{L} \right)^2 \)$.
   - Solve the ODE for $\( T(t) \)$:
     $\[
     T_n(t) = e^{-k \lambda_n t}.
     \]$
   - The general solution is:
     $\[
     u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right) e^{-k \left( \frac{n \pi}{L} \right)^2 t}.
     \]$
   - Use the initial condition to find $\( B_n \)$:
     $\[
     f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right).
     \]$
     The coefficients $\( B_n \)$ are the Fourier sine series coefficients of \( f(x) \).

2. **Solve the wave equation $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$ with boundary conditions $\( u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 \)$ and initial conditions $\( u(x, 0) = f(x) \)$, $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x, 0) = g(x) \)$**:
   - Assume $\( u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) \)$.
   - Separate variables:
     $\[
     \frac{T''(t)}{c^2 T(t)} = \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\lambda.
     \]$
   - Solve the ODE for $\( X(x) \)$:
     $\[
     X''(x) + \lambda X(x) = 0, \quad X(0) = X(L) = 0.
     \]$
     The solutions are $\( X_n(x) = \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right) \) with \( \lambda_n = \left( \frac{n \pi}{L} \right)^2 \)$.
   - Solve the ODE for $\( T(t) \)$:
     $\[
     T_n(t) = A_n \cos\left( \frac{n \pi c t}{L} \right) + B_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi c t}{L} \right).
     \]$
   - The general solution is:
     $\[
     u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left[ A_n \cos\left( \frac{n \pi c t}{L} \right) + B_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi c t}{L} \right) \right] \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right).
     \]$
   - Use the initial conditions to find $\( A_n \) and \( B_n \)$:
     $\[
     f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty A_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right), \quad g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty B_n \frac{n \pi c}{L} \sin\left( \frac{n \pi x}{L} \right).
     \]$
     The coefficients $\( A_n \) and \( B_n \)$ are the Fourier sine series coefficients of $\( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)$, respectively.
