Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, particularly right-angled triangles. It is widely used in science, engineering, architecture, and navigation. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Key Concepts in Trigonometry**

1. **Right-Angled Triangles**:
   - A triangle with one 90° angle.
   - The side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**.
   - The other two sides are called **legs** (adjacent and opposite to a given angle).

2. **Trigonometric Ratios**:
   - Defined for a right-angled triangle with respect to one of its non-right angles $(\( \theta \))$:
     - **Sine $(\( \sin \))$**: $\( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \)$.
     - **Cosine $(\( \cos \))$**: $\( \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \)$.
     - **Tangent $(\( \tan \))$**: $\( \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}} \)$.

3. **Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios**:
   - **Cosecant $(\( \csc \))$**: $\( \csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)} \)$.
   - **Secant $(\( \sec \))$**: $\( \sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \)$.
   - **Cotangent $(\( \cot \))$**: $\( \cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} \)$.

4. **Unit Circle**:
   - A circle with radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the coordinate plane.
   - Used to define trigonometric functions for all angles, not just those in right-angled triangles.
   - For an angle $\( \theta \)$, the coordinates on the unit circle are $\( (\cos(\theta)$, $\sin(\theta)) \)$.

5. **Angles**:
   - Measured in degrees (°) or radians.
   - Common angles: 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°, 270°, 360°.

6. **Trigonometric Identities**:
   - Equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all angles.
   - Examples:
     - Pythagorean Identity: $\( \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1 \)$.
     - Sum and Difference Formulas:
       $\[
       \sin(A \pm B) = \sin(A)\cos(B) \pm \cos(A)\sin(B)
       \]$
       
       $\[
       \cos(A \pm B) = \cos(A)\cos(B) \mp \sin(A)\sin(B)
       \]$

### **Applications of Trigonometry**

1. **Physics**:
   - Used to analyze forces, motion, and waves.

2. **Engineering**:
   - Essential for designing structures, machines, and electrical circuits.

3. **Astronomy**:
   - Helps calculate distances between celestial objects.

4. **Navigation**:
   - Used in GPS systems, aviation, and maritime navigation.

5. **Computer Graphics**:
   - Used to render 3D objects and animations.

6. **Architecture**:
   - Helps design buildings and bridges.

### **Important Formulas in Trigonometry**

1. **Pythagorean Theorem**:
   $\[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]$
   - For a right-angled triangle with legs \( a \) and \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \).

2. **Law of Sines**:
   $\[
   \frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
   \]$
   - For any triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) and opposite angles \( A, B, C \).

3. **Law of Cosines**:
   $\[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(C)
   \]$
   - For any triangle with sides \( a, b, c \) and angle \( C \) opposite side \( c \).

4. **Area of a Triangle**:
   $\[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C)
   \]$
   - For a triangle with sides \( a \) and \( b \), and included angle \( C \).

### **Example Problems**

1. **Find $\( \sin(30°) \)$**:
   $\[
   \sin(30°) = \frac{1}{2}.
   \]$

2. **Calculate the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle with legs 3 cm and 4 cm**:
   $\[
   c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \, \text{cm}.
   \]$

3. **Solve for \( x \) in the equation $\( \sin(x) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)$**:
   $\[
   x = 45° \quad \text{or} \quad x = 135°.
   \]$

4. **Find the area of a triangle with sides 5 cm and 7 cm, and an included angle of 60°**:
   $\[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}(5)(7)\sin(60°) = \frac{1}{2}(35)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{35\sqrt{3}}{4} \, \text{cm}^2.
   \]$
