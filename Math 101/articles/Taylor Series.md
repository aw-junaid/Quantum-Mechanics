The **Taylor series** is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms, where each term is derived from the function's derivatives at a single point. It is a powerful tool in calculus and mathematical analysis, used to approximate functions, solve differential equations, and analyze the behavior of functions. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **Definition of the Taylor Series**

The Taylor series of a function \( f(x) \) about a point \( a \) is given by:
$\[
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n,
\]$
where:
- $\( f^{(n)}(a) \)$: The \( n \)-th derivative of \( f(x) \) evaluated at \( x = a \).
- $\( n! \)$: The factorial of \( n \).
- $\( (x - a)^n \)$: The \( n \)-th power of $\( (x - a) \)$.

If \( a = 0 \), the series is called the **Maclaurin series**:
$\[
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} x^n.
\]$

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Taylor Polynomial**:
   - A finite approximation of the Taylor series, using the first \( N \) terms:
     $\[
     P_N(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n.
     \]$
   - As \( N \) increases, $\( P_N(x) \)$ becomes a better approximation of \( f(x) \).

2. **Remainder Term**:
   - The difference between the function and its Taylor polynomial:
     $\[
     R_N(x) = f(x) - P_N(x).
     \]$
   - The remainder can be expressed using the **Lagrange form**:
     $\[
     R_N(x) = \frac{f^{(N+1)}(c)}{(N+1)!} (x - a)^{N+1},
     \]$
     where \( c \) is some point between \( a \) and \( x \).

3. **Convergence**:
   - The Taylor series converges to $\( f(x) \)$ if $\( \lim_{N \to \infty} R_N(x) = 0 \)$.
   - The interval of convergence depends on the function and the point \( a \).

### **Common Taylor Series**

1. **Exponential Function**:
   $\[
   e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots.
   \]$

2. **Sine Function**:
   $\[
   \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dots.
   \]$

3. **Cosine Function**:
   $\[
   \cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \dots.
   \]$

4. **Natural Logarithm**:
   $\[
   \ln(1 + x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} x^n = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \dots \quad \text{for} \quad |x| < 1.
   \]$

5. **Geometric Series**:
   $\[
   \frac{1}{1 - x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots \quad \text{for} \quad |x| < 1.
   \]$

3. **Physics and Engineering**:
   - Taylor series are used to model physical phenomena and simplify complex equations.

4. **Numerical Analysis**:
   - Taylor series are used in algorithms for numerical integration, differentiation, and solving equations.

5. **Error Analysis**:
   - The remainder term helps estimate the error in approximations.

### **Example Problems**

1. **Find the Taylor series for \( f(x) = e^x \) about \( a = 0 \)**:
   - The derivatives of $\( e^x \) are all \( e^x \), and \( f^{(n)}(0) = 1 \)$.
   - Taylor series:
     $\[
     e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \dots.
     \]$

2. **Find the Taylor series for $\( f(x) = \sin(x) \) about \( a = 0 \)$**:
   - The derivatives of $\( \sin(x) \) cycle through \( \sin(x) \), \( \cos(x) \), \( -\sin(x) \), \( -\cos(x) \)$, and repeat.
   - At \( x = 0 \), the derivatives are $\( 0, 1, 0, -1, \dots \)$.
   - Taylor series:
     $\[
     \sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \dots.
     \]$

3. **Approximate $\( \sqrt{1.1} \)$ using the Taylor series for $\( f(x) = \sqrt{1 + x} \)$ about \( a = 0 \)**:
   - Compute the first few derivatives:
     $\[
     f(x) = (1 + x)^{1/2}, \quad f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + x)^{-1/2}, \quad f''(x) = -\frac{1}{4}(1 + x)^{-3/2}.
     \]$
   - Evaluate at \( x = 0 \):
     $\[
     f(0) = 1, \quad f'(0) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad f''(0) = -\frac{1}{4}.
     \]$
   - Taylor polynomial of degree 2:
     $\[
     P_2(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{8}x^2.
     \]$
   - Approximate $\( \sqrt{1.1} \)$ by setting \( x = 0.1 \):
     $\[
     P_2(0.1) = 1 + \frac{1}{2}(0.1) - \frac{1}{8}(0.1)^2 = 1 + 0.05 - 0.00125 = 1.04875.
     \]$
   - The actual value of $\( \sqrt{1.1} \)$ is approximately $\( 1.04881 \)$.

4. **Find the Taylor series for $\( f(x) = \ln(1 + x) \) about \( a = 0 \)$**:
   - Compute the derivatives:
     $\[
     f(x) = \ln(1 + x), \quad f'(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x}, \quad f''(x) = -\frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}, \quad f'''(x) = \frac{2}{(1 + x)^3}.
     \]$
   - Evaluate at \( x = 0 \):
     $\[
     f(0) = 0, \quad f'(0) = 1, \quad f''(0) = -1, \quad f'''(0) = 2.
     \]$
   - Taylor series:
     $\[
     \ln(1 + x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} x^n = x - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} - \dots.
     \]$
