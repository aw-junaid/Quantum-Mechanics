# **Equations: Understanding the Concept**  

An **equation** is a mathematical statement that shows **two expressions are equal** using the **equal sign (=)**. Equations are fundamental in **algebra, physics, engineering, and real-world problem-solving**.  

---

## **1. Basic Structure of an Equation**  
An equation has **two sides** separated by an equal sign:  

$\[
\text{Left Side} = \text{Right Side}
\]$

**Example:**  
$\[
3x + 5 = 11
\]$  
- **Left Side:** $\( 3x + 5 \)$  
- **Right Side:** $\( 11 \)$  
- The equation is **true** when $\( x = 2 \)$.

## **2. Types of Equations**  

### **A. Linear Equations**  
An equation where the **highest exponent of the variable is 1**.  
**General form:**  
$\[
ax + b = 0
\]$  
**Example:**  
$\[
2x + 3 = 7
\]$  
$(Solution: \( x = 2 \))$  

**Graph:** A straight line.  

---

### **B. Quadratic Equations**  
An equation where the **highest exponent of the variable is 2**.  
**General form:**  
$\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]$  
**Example:**  
$\[
x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
\]$  
$(Solutions: \( x = 2, x = 3 \))$  

**Graph:** A **parabola** (U-shaped curve).  

---

### **C. Polynomial Equations**  
Equations with **higher exponents** (3 or more).  
**Example:**  
$\[
x^3 - 4x + 2 = 0
\]$  

---

### **D. Exponential Equations**  
An equation where the **variable is in the exponent**.  
**Example:**  
$\[
2^x = 8
\]$  
$(Solution: \( x = 3 \))$  

---

### **E. Logarithmic Equations**  
Equations involving logarithms.  
**Example:**  
$\[
\log_2 x = 3
\]$  
$(Solution: \( x = 8 \))$  

---

### **F. Radical Equations**  
Equations involving square roots.  
**Example:**  
$\[
\sqrt{x} = 5
\]$
$(Solution: \( x = 25 \))$  

---

## **3. Solving Equations**  

### **A. Solving Linear Equations**  
$\[
2x + 3 = 7
\]$  
**Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides:  
$\[
2x = 4
\]$  
**Step 2:** Divide by 2:  
$\[
x = 2
\] $ 

---

### **B. Solving Quadratic Equations**  

1. **Factoring Method:**  
   $\[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
   \]$  
   Factor:  
   $\[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]$  
   Solutions: $\( x = 2, x = 3 \)$.  

2. **Quadratic Formula:**  
   $\[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]$  
   Used when factoring is difficult.

## **4. Applications of Equations**  
- **Physics:** $\( F = ma \)$ (Force = Mass Ã— Acceleration).  
- **Finance:** Interest formula $\( A = P(1 + r)^t \)$.  
- **Engineering:** Design calculations.  
- **Programming:** Algorithm logic.

### **Conclusion**  
Equations are **fundamental tools** in mathematics and real-world problem-solving. Mastering equations helps in **science, engineering, and technology**.
