Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It provides tools and methods to make sense of data, draw conclusions, and make informed decisions. Statistics is widely used in fields such as science, economics, social sciences, business, and engineering. Here's a detailed explanation:

### **Key Concepts in Statistics**

1. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset.
   - Includes measures of central tendency and measures of variability.

2. **Inferential Statistics**:
   - Uses sample data to make generalizations (inferences) about a population.
   - Includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.

3. **Population and Sample**:
   - **Population**: The entire set of individuals or items of interest.
   - **Sample**: A subset of the population used to represent the whole.

4. **Variables**:
   - **Quantitative Variables**: Numerical data (e.g., height, weight).
   - **Categorical Variables**: Non-numerical data (e.g., gender, color).

### **Measures of Central Tendency**

1. **Mean**:
   - The average of all data points.
   - Formula: $\( \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} \)$.

2. **Median**:
   - The middle value when data is arranged in ascending order.
   - For an even number of data points, it is the average of the two middle values.

3. **Mode**:
   - The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.

### **Measures of Variability**

1. **Range**:
   - The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

2. **Variance**:
   - Measures the spread of data points around the mean.
   - Formula: $\( \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n} \)$.

3. **Standard Deviation**:
   - The square root of the variance.
   - Formula: $\( \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}} \)$.

### **Probability Distributions**

1. **Normal Distribution**:
   - A bell-shaped curve symmetric about the mean.
   - Described by the mean $(\( \mu \))$ and standard deviation $(\( \sigma \))$.

2. **Binomial Distribution**:
   - Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials.
   - Parameters: number of trials $(\( n \))$ and probability of success $(\( p \))$.

3. **Poisson Distribution**:
   - Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.
   - Parameter: average rate $(\( \lambda \))$.

### **Inferential Statistics**

1. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Tests a claim about a population parameter.
   - Steps:
     - State the null hypothesis $(\( H_0 \))$ and alternative hypothesis $(\( H_1 \))$.
     - Choose a significance level $(\( \alpha \))$.
     - Calculate the test statistic and p-value.
     - Make a decision to reject or fail to reject $\( H_0 \)$.

2. **Confidence Intervals**:
   - Provides a range of values within which the population parameter is expected to lie.
   - Formula for mean: $\( \bar{x} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \)$.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Examines the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
   - Linear regression: \( y = mx + b \).

### **Applications of Statistics**

1. **Science**:
   - Used to analyze experimental data and validate hypotheses.

2. **Economics**:
   - Helps in forecasting economic trends and analyzing market data.

3. **Medicine**:
   - Used in clinical trials and epidemiological studies.

4. **Business**:
   - Assists in market research, quality control, and decision-making.

5. **Social Sciences**:
   - Used to study human behavior and social phenomena.

### **Example Problems**

1. **Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the dataset: 3, 5, 7, 7, 9**:
   - Mean: $\( \frac{3 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 9}{5} = 6.2 \)$.
   - Median: \( 7 \).
   - Mode: \( 7 \).

2. **Find the variance and standard deviation for the dataset: 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9**:
   - Mean: $\( \frac{2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 9}{8} = 5 \)$.
   - Variance: $\( \frac{(2-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (4-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (5-5)^2 + (7-5)^2 + (9-5)^2}{8} = 4 \)$.
   - Standard Deviation: $\( \sqrt{4} = 2 \)$.

3. **Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the mean of a sample is significantly different from a population mean of 100**:
   - Given: Sample mean $\( \bar{x} = 105 \)$, population standard deviation $\( \sigma = 10 \)$, sample size $\( n = 25 \)$.
   - Test statistic: $\( z = \frac{105 - 100}{10 / \sqrt{25}} = 2.5 \)$.
   - Compare to critical value at $\( \alpha = 0.05 \)$ $(e.g., \( z = 1.96 \))$.
   - Since $\( 2.5 > 1.96 \)$, reject $\( H_0 \)$.
