### **Factors: Understanding the Basics**  

A **factor** of a number is any whole number that divides the given number **exactly** (without leaving a remainder).  

#### **1. What Are Factors?**  
If **A × B = C**, then **A** and **B** are factors of **C**.  

**Example:**  
- **Factors of 12:**  
  - $\( 1 \times 12 = 12 \)$  
  - $\( 2 \times 6 = 12 \)$  
  - $\( 3 \times 4 = 12 \)$  
  - **So, the factors of 12 are:** **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**

### **2. Finding Factors of a Number**  
To find the factors of a number:  
1. Start dividing by **1** and continue up to the number itself.  
2. Check for numbers that divide evenly (no remainder).  

#### **Example: Factors of 18**  
- **1 × 18 = 18**  
- **2 × 9 = 18**  
- **3 × 6 = 18**  
- **So, the factors of 18 are:** **1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18**

### **3. Prime and Composite Numbers**  
- **Prime Numbers**: Have only **two factors** (1 and itself).  
  - Example: **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...**  
- **Composite Numbers**: Have **more than two factors**.  
  - Example: **4 (1,2,4), 6 (1,2,3,6), 8 (1,2,4,8)**

### **4. Common Factors and Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**  
- **Common Factors**: Factors that **two or more numbers** share.  
- **Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**: The largest factor that two numbers have in common.  

#### **Example: Find GCF of 24 and 36**  
- **Factors of 24**: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24**  
- **Factors of 36**: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36**  
- **Common Factors**: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12**  
- **GCF**: **12**

### **5. Real-World Applications of Factors**  
- **Dividing objects into equal groups** (e.g., sharing candy among friends).  
- **Finding common denominators in fractions**.  
- **Optimizing product packaging** (e.g., arranging items in boxes).  
- **Cryptography** (Prime factorization is used in encryption).  

### **Conclusion**  
Factors are fundamental in mathematics and appear in algebra, number theory, and real-life problem-solving. **Understanding factors helps in division, simplifications, and advanced mathematical concepts!**
