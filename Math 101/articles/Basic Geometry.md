### **Basic Geometry: Understanding Shapes, Angles, and Space**  

**Geometry** is a branch of mathematics that deals with **shapes, sizes, positions, and properties of space**. It is one of the oldest fields of mathematics and is widely used in everyday life, engineering, and science.

## **1. Basic Geometric Terms**  

- **Point (•):** A location in space. It has no size, width, or depth.  
- **Line (↔):** A straight one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions.  
- **Line Segment (—):** A part of a line with two endpoints.  
- **Ray (→):** A part of a line that extends infinitely in one direction.  
- **Plane:** A flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely.

## **2. Types of Angles**  

An **angle** is formed when two rays meet at a common endpoint (vertex).  

- **Acute Angle:** Less than **90°**  
- **Right Angle:** Exactly **90°**  
- **Obtuse Angle:** More than **90°** but less than **180°**  
- **Straight Angle:** Exactly **180°**  

### **Angle Relationships**  
- **Complementary Angles:** Two angles that sum to **90°**  
- **Supplementary Angles:** Two angles that sum to **180°**  
- **Adjacent Angles:** Angles that share a common side  
- **Vertical Angles:** Opposite angles when two lines intersect (always equal)

## **3. Types of Triangles**  

Triangles are **3-sided polygons** with the sum of their interior angles always **180°**.  

### **By Sides:**  
- **Scalene Triangle:** All sides are different.  
- **Isosceles Triangle:** Two sides are equal.  
- **Equilateral Triangle:** All three sides are equal (each angle is **60°**).  

### **By Angles:**  
- **Acute Triangle:** All angles are less than **90°**.  
- **Right Triangle:** One angle is **90°**.  
- **Obtuse Triangle:** One angle is greater than **90°**.

## **4. Quadrilaterals**  

A **quadrilateral** is a **four-sided** polygon.  

| Quadrilateral | Properties |
|--------------|------------|
| Square | 4 equal sides, 4 right angles |
| Rectangle | Opposite sides equal, 4 right angles |
| Parallelogram | Opposite sides and angles equal |
| Rhombus | All sides equal, opposite angles equal |
| Trapezium (Trapezoid) | One pair of parallel sides |

## **5. Circles**  

A **circle** is a set of points equidistant from a center.  

### **Important Circle Terms:**  
- **Radius (r):** Distance from center to edge.  
- **Diameter (d):** The longest line through the center (d = 2r).  
- **Circumference (C):** The perimeter of a circle. Formula:  
  $\[
  C = 2\pi r
  \]$  
- **Area (A):** The space inside a circle. Formula:  
  $\[
  A = \pi r^2
  \]$

## **6. Perimeter and Area of Common Shapes**  

| Shape | Perimeter Formula | Area Formula |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| Square | $\( P = 4s \)$ | $\( A = s^2 \)$ |
| Rectangle | $\( P = 2(l + w) \)$ | $\( A = l \times w \)$ |
| Triangle | $\( P = a + b + c \)$ | $\( A = \frac{1}{2} b h \)$ |
| Circle | $\( C = 2\pi r \)$ | $\( A = \pi r^2 \)$ |

## **7. 3D Shapes (Solid Geometry)**  

| Shape | Faces | Edges | Vertices |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| Cube | 6 | 12 | 8 |
| Rectangular Prism | 6 | 12 | 8 |
| Sphere | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Cylinder | 3 | 2 | 0 |
| Cone | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Pyramid | 5 | 8 | 5 |
