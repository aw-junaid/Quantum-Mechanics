# **Cartesian Coordinates: Understanding the System**  

The **Cartesian coordinate system** is used to describe the location of points in a plane using **ordered pairs (x, y)**. It is widely used in **geometry, algebra, physics, and computer graphics**.  

---

## **1. Understanding Cartesian Coordinates**  

### **A. Coordinate Plane**  
The Cartesian plane consists of:  
1. **X-Axis** → The horizontal axis.  
2. **Y-Axis** → The vertical axis.  
3. **Origin (0,0)** → The point where the X-axis and Y-axis intersect.  
4. **Quadrants** → The plane is divided into four regions (quadrants).  

### **B. Ordered Pairs (x, y)**  
Each point on the plane is represented by **(x, y)** where:  
- **x** → Distance from the Y-axis (horizontal movement).  
- **y** → Distance from the X-axis (vertical movement).  

**Example:**  
- **Point (3, 2)** → Move **3 units right** and **2 units up**.  
- **Point (-4, -5)** → Move **4 units left** and **5 units down**.

## **2. Quadrants of the Cartesian Plane**  

| Quadrant | Sign of (x, y) | Example Point |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **I**    | (+, +)       | (3, 4)        |
| **II**   | (-, +)       | (-5, 6)       |
| **III**  | (-, -)       | (-2, -3)      |
| **IV**   | (+, -)       | (7, -1)       |

**Visual Representation:**  
```
        +Y
   II   |   I
        |
--------|-------- +X
        |
   III  |   IV
        -Y
```

## **3. Distance Between Two Points**  

To find the distance **d** between two points $\( (x_1, y_1) \)$ and $\( (x_2, y_2) \)$, use the **distance formula**:  
$\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]$

### **Example:**  
Find the distance between \( (1, 2) \) and \( (4, 6) \).  

$\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (6 - 2)^2}
\]$

$\[
d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]$  

---

## **4. Midpoint Between Two Points**  

The **midpoint** \( M \) between two points $\( (x_1, y_1) \)$ and $\( (x_2, y_2) \)$ is:  
$\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]$  

### **Example:**  
Find the midpoint between \( (2, 4) \) and \( (6, 8) \).  

$\[
M = \left( \frac{2+6}{2}, \frac{4+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{8}{2}, \frac{12}{2} \right) = (4,6)
\]$ 

---

## **5. Slope of a Line**  

The **slope (m)** measures how steep a line is between two points $\( (x_1, y_1) \)$ and $\( (x_2, y_2) \)$.  

### **Slope Formula:**  
$\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]$  

**Example:**  
Find the slope between $\( (1, 2) \)$ and \( (4, 6) \).  

$\[
m = \frac{6 - 2}{4 - 1} = \frac{4}{3}
\]$  

**Slope Interpretation:**  
- **Positive slope** → Line goes **upward** (left to right).  
- **Negative slope** → Line goes **downward** (left to right).  
- **Zero slope** → **Horizontal line** (no rise).  
- **Undefined slope** → **Vertical line** (no run).  

---

## **6. Equation of a Line**  

The most common equation for a straight line is:  
$\[
y = mx + b
\]$  
where:  
- **m** = slope.  
- **b** = y-intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis).  

**Example:**  
If a line has slope $\( m = 2 \)$ and passes through $\( (1, 3) \)$, find its equation.  

Use $\( y = mx + b \)$:  
$\[
3 = 2(1) + b
\]$

$\[
b = 1
\]$  

So, the equation is:  
$\[
y = 2x + 1
\]$

## **7. Real-World Applications of Cartesian Coordinates**  

- **Navigation & GPS** (Locating positions using latitude and longitude).  
- **Computer Graphics & Gaming** (Placing objects in a 2D/3D space).  
- **Engineering & Physics** (Modeling forces, motion, and trajectories).  
- **Economics & Data Science** (Plotting graphs and trends).
