Differential equations are mathematical equations that relate a function to its derivatives. They describe how a quantity changes over time or space and are fundamental in modeling various physical, biological, and engineering systems. The solutions to differential equations are functions that satisfy the relationship defined by the equation.


### Types of Differential Equations:
1. **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**
   - Involve derivatives of a function with respect to a single variable.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 \)$.

2. **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**
   - Involve derivatives of a function with respect to multiple variables.
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0 \)$.

3. **Linear vs. Nonlinear Differential Equations:**
   - Linear: The dependent variable and its derivatives appear linearly.
   - Nonlinear: The dependent variable or its derivatives appear in a nonlinear manner.

### Examples in Math and Physics:

#### 1. **Exponential Growth (Math Example):**
   - **Equation:** $\( \frac{dy}{dt} = ky \)$.
   - **Description:** This ODE describes a quantity \( y \) that grows at a rate proportional to its current value.
   - **Solution:** $\( y(t) = y_0 e^{kt} \)$, where $\( y_0 \)$ is the initial value of \( y \).

#### 2. **Simple Harmonic Oscillator (Physics Example):**
   - **Equation:** $\( \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0 \)$.
   - **Description:** This ODE describes the motion of a mass on a spring or a pendulum, where \( x \) is the displacement and $\( \omega \)$ is the angular frequency.
   - **Solution:** $\( x(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t) \)$, where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants determined by initial conditions.

#### 3. **Heat Equation (Physics Example):**
   - **Equation:** $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.
   - **Description:** This PDE describes how heat diffuses through a one-dimensional rod over time, where $\( u(x, t) \)$ is the temperature at position \( x \) and time \( t \), and $\( \alpha \)$ is the thermal diffusivity.
   - **Solution:** Depends on boundary and initial conditions, often involving Fourier series.

#### 4. **Newton's Second Law (Physics Example):**
   - **Equation:** $\( m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = F(x, t) \)$.
   - **Description:** This ODE describes the motion of an object under a force \( F \), where \( m \) is the mass and $\( x(t) \)$ is the position.
   - **Solution:** Depends on the form of $\( F(x, t) \)$. For example, if $\( F = -kx \)$ (Hooke's law), the solution is simple harmonic motion.

#### 5. **Wave Equation (Physics Example):**
   - **Equation:** $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.
   - **Description:** This PDE describes the propagation of waves (e.g., sound, light) in one dimension, where $\( u(x, t) \)$ is the wave displacement and \( c \) is the wave speed.
   - **Solution:** $\( u(x, t) = f(x - ct) + g(x + ct) \), where \( f \) and \( g \)$ are arbitrary functions representing waves traveling in opposite directions.
