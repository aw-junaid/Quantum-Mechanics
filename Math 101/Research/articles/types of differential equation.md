Differential equations can be classified into several types based on their properties, order, and linearity. Below is a summary of the main types of differential equations, along with examples for each.

---

### **1. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**
ODEs involve derivatives of a function with respect to a single independent variable.

#### **Types of ODEs:**

1. **First-Order ODEs:**
   - Involve only the first derivative of the function.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 \)$.

2. **Second-Order ODEs:**
   - Involve the second derivative of the function.
   - Example: $\( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 \)$.

3. **Higher-Order ODEs:**
   - Involve derivatives of order higher than two.
   - Example: $\( \frac{d^3 y}{dx^3} + 2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + \frac{dy}{dx} + y = 0 \)$.

### **2. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**
PDEs involve derivatives of a function with respect to multiple independent variables.

#### **Types of PDEs:**

1. **First-Order PDEs:**
   - Involve only the first partial derivatives of the function.
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 \)$.

2. **Second-Order PDEs:**
   - Involve second partial derivatives of the function.
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0 \)$ (Laplace's equation).

3. **Higher-Order PDEs:**
   - Involve partial derivatives of order higher than two.
   - Example: $\( \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} + \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial y^3} = 0 \)$.

---

### **3. Linear vs. Nonlinear Differential Equations:**

1. **Linear Differential Equations:**
   - The dependent variable and its derivatives appear linearly (no powers or products).
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0 \)$.

2. **Nonlinear Differential Equations:**
   - The dependent variable or its derivatives appear nonlinearly (e.g., powers, products, or transcendental functions).
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + y^2 = 0 \)$.

---

### **4. Homogeneous vs. Nonhomogeneous Differential Equations:**

1. **Homogeneous Differential Equations:**
   - All terms depend on the dependent variable or its derivatives.
   - Example: $\( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = 0 \)$.

2. **Nonhomogeneous Differential Equations:**
   - Include additional terms that do not depend on the dependent variable.
   - Example: $\( \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + y = x \)$.

---

### **5. Autonomous vs. Nonautonomous Differential Equations:**

1. **Autonomous Differential Equations:**
   - The independent variable does not explicitly appear in the equation.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = y(1 - y) \)$.

2. **Nonautonomous Differential Equations:**
   - The independent variable explicitly appears in the equation.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = xy \)$.

### **6. Special Types of ODEs:**

1. **Separable ODEs:**
   - Can be written as $\( f(y) dy = g(x) dx \)$.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = xy \)$.

2. **Exact ODEs:**
   - Can be written as $\( M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy = 0 \), where \( \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x} \)$.
   - Example: $\( (2xy) dx + (x^2 + 1) dy = 0 \)$.

3. **Bernoulli ODEs:**
   - Can be written as $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x) y^n \)$.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} + y = y^2 \)$.

4. **Riccati ODEs:**
   - Can be written as $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = P(x) y^2 + Q(x) y + R(x) \)$.
   - Example: $\( \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 + x y + 1 \)$.

### **7. Special Types of PDEs:**

1. **Elliptic PDEs:**
   - Describe steady-state phenomena.
   - Example: Laplace's equation $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0 \)$.

2. **Parabolic PDEs:**
   - Describe diffusion processes.
   - Example: Heat equation $\( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.

3. **Hyperbolic PDEs:**
   - Describe wave propagation.
   - Example: Wave equation $\( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)$.

   \]$

3. **Nonlinear ODE:**

   \]$

4. **First-Order PDE:**
   $\[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0.
   \]$

5. **Second-Order PDE (Heat Equation):**
   $\[
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}.
   \]$

6. **Bernoulli ODE:**
   $\[
   \frac{dy}{dx} + y = y^2.
   \]$

7. **Exact ODE:**
   $\[
   (2xy) dx + (x^2 + 1) dy = 0.
   \]$
