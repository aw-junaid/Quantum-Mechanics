The life and death of a star, as well as the formation of black holes, depend on the star's **mass**.

### **1. How Stars Die: Lifecycle Based on Mass**
Stars spend their lives fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. When they exhaust their fuel, their fate depends on their initial mass:

#### **A. Low-Mass Stars (< 8 times the Sun’s mass)**
- **Red Giant Phase**: Expands as the core contracts and outer layers cool.
- **Planetary Nebula**: Sheds outer layers, leaving behind a dense **white dwarf** (Earth-sized, supported by electron degeneracy pressure).
- **End State**: White dwarf slowly cools into a "black dwarf" (theoretical, as the universe isn’t old enough for any to exist yet).

#### **B. High-Mass Stars (> 8 times the Sun’s mass)**
- **Supergiant Phase**: Fuses heavier elements (carbon, oxygen, up to iron) in layered shells.
- **Iron Core Collapse**: Iron cannot release energy via fusion. The core collapses in seconds.
  - **Supernova Explosion**: The collapsing core rebounds, triggering a cataclysmic explosion visible across galaxies. This disperses heavy elements (like gold, uranium) into space.
  - **Remnant**: What’s left depends on the core’s mass:
    - **Neutron Star**: If the core is ~1.4–3 solar masses, protons and electrons merge into neutrons, forming a city-sized neutron star (a teaspoon weighs a billion tons!).
    - **Black Hole**: If the core exceeds ~3 solar masses, gravity overpowers **all forces**, and the core collapses infinitely.

### **2. Black Hole Formation**
- **Core Collapse**: After a supernova, if the remnant core is too massive for neutron degeneracy pressure to resist gravity, it collapses into a **singularity**—a point of infinite density.
- **Event Horizon**: The boundary around the singularity where escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. Anything crossing it, including light, is trapped.
  - **Schwarzschild Radius**: The radius of the event horizon: $\( R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2} \), where \( M \)$ is the mass.
- **Types of Black Holes**:
  - **Stellar-Mass**: Formed from collapsing stars (3–100+ solar masses).
  - **Supermassive**: Millions to billions of solar masses, found at galaxy centers (origin still debated—may grow via mergers or gas accretion).
  - **Primordial**: Hypothetical tiny black holes formed in the early universe.

### **3. What Happens After a Black Hole Forms?**
- **Spacetime Warp**: Black holes bend spacetime so severely that time slows near the event horizon (as predicted by general relativity).
- **Accretion Disk**: Infalling gas and dust spiral around the black hole, heating to millions of degrees and emitting X-rays.
- **Hawking Radiation** (theoretical): Quantum effects allow black holes to slowly evaporate over trillions of years—though this is negligible for large black holes.
- **Mergers**: Black holes can collide, releasing gravitational waves (detected by observatories like LIGO).

---

### **Key Observations & Significance**
- **Supernovae**: Observed as bright transient events (e.g., SN 1987A).
- **Neutron Stars**: Detected as pulsars (lighthouse-like radio emissions).
- **Black Holes**: Confirmed via:
  - X-ray binaries (e.g., Cygnus X-1).
  - Gravitational waves from mergers (LIGO/Virgo).
  - Event Horizon Telescope imaging (e.g., M87* and Sagittarius A*).

### **Why It Matters**
- **Stellar Recycling**: Supernovae seed the universe with elements essential for planets and life.
- **Cosmic Engines**: Black holes influence galaxy evolution and star formation.
- **Testing Physics**: Black holes challenge our understanding of quantum mechanics and relativity.

In short, a star’s death is a spectacular transformation—either a quiet fade into a white dwarf, a violent supernova birthing a neutron star, or the ultimate collapse into a black hole, where spacetime itself is reshaped.
