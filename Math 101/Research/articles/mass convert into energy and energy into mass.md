Mass and energy are fundamentally interconvertible, as expressed by Einstein’s famous equation E = mc². Here’s what that means in practice:

### Mass-to-Energy Conversion
- **Nuclear Reactions:**  
  In processes like nuclear fusion (in the Sun) or fission (in nuclear reactors), a small portion of the mass of atomic nuclei is converted into energy. The released energy comes from the difference between the mass of the original nuclei and the mass of the resulting particles, with that “missing” mass being converted to energy.
  
- **Annihilation:**  
  When a particle meets its corresponding antiparticle (for example, an electron and a positron), they annihilate each other, converting their mass completely into energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.

### Energy-to-Mass Conversion
- **Pair Production:**  
  In high-energy environments, energy can convert into mass. For instance, when a high-energy photon passes near a heavy nucleus, it can transform into an electron-positron pair. This is a direct demonstration of energy creating mass, as the photon's energy becomes the mass of the new particles.
  
- **Particle Collisions:**  
  In particle accelerators, particles are smashed together at high speeds. The kinetic energy from these collisions can be converted into new particles, essentially turning energy into mass.

### The Fundamental Principle
Einstein’s equation shows that mass is just a concentrated form of energy. Because the speed of light squared (c²) is an enormous number, even a tiny amount of mass corresponds to a tremendous amount of energy. This principle is a cornerstone of modern physics and underlies many processes in both astrophysics and particle physics.
