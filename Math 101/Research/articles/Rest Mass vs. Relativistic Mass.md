### **1. Light (Photons) and Mass**
- **Photons are massless:** According to the Standard Model of particle physics, photons (particles of light) have **zero rest mass**. They always travel at the speed of light $(\( c \))$ in a vacuum.
- **But they carry energy and momentum:** A photon’s energy is tied to its frequency $(\( E = h\nu \)$, where $\( h \)$ is Planck’s constant). Even without mass, photons exert radiation pressure and interact gravitationally (via their energy).

### **2. Mass-Energy Equivalence $(\( E = mc^2 \))$**
Einstein’s equation shows that **mass is a form of energy**, and energy can behave like mass:
- **Mass → Light:** When mass is converted into energy (e.g., nuclear fusion in stars, particle-antiparticle annihilation), some of that energy emerges as light.
  - Example: The Sun loses ~4 million tons of mass per second via fusion, releasing energy (including sunlight).
- **Light → Effective "Mass":** While photons lack rest mass, their energy contributes to the **relativistic mass** $(\( E/c^2 \))$ in systems. For example:
  - A box of light has more inertia (resistance to motion) due to the photons’ energy.

### **3. Gravitational Interaction Between Light and Mass**
- **Light bends around mass:** General relativity predicts that massive objects (like stars, black holes) warp spacetime, deflecting the path of light (**gravitational lensing**).
- **Light affects spacetime:** Though photons are massless, their energy contributes to the stress-energy tensor in Einstein’s equations, influencing spacetime curvature.

### **4. When Mass Becomes Light**
- **Particle Annihilation:** When matter (e.g., an electron) and antimatter (e.g., a positron) collide, their mass is entirely converted into energy, often as gamma-ray photons:
  $\[
  e^- + e^+ \rightarrow 2\gamma \quad (\text{energy} = 2m_e c^2).
  \]$
- **Black Hole Evaporation:** Via **Hawking radiation**, black holes emit particles (including photons) by quantum effects near their event horizons, slowly losing mass.

---

### **5. Common Misconceptions**
- **"Light has mass":** No—photons are massless, but their energy and momentum mimic some properties of mass.
- **"Mass turns into light":** Only a fraction of mass-converted energy becomes light; other forms (kinetic energy, heat) are also involved.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Light itself is massless**, but it carries energy and momentum derived from mass-energy equivalence.
- **Mass can transform into light** (and vice versa) under extreme conditions, governed by $\( E = mc^2 \)$.
- **Gravity links them**: Mass warps spacetime, bending light, while light’s energy influences spacetime’s structure.

This interplay defines phenomena from starlight to the universe’s evolution, bridging relativity and quantum mechanics.
