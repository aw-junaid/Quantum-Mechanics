### 1. Do Photons Have Mass?

- **Rest Mass vs. Relativistic Mass:**  
  Photons—the particles of light—are considered to have zero *rest mass*. This means that when they are at rest (hypothetically, though photons always move at the speed of light), they have no mass. However, the term *relativistic mass* (an older concept) was once used to describe the mass a particle appears to have when in motion. In modern physics, we focus on *rest mass* (which is zero for photons) while acknowledging that photons carry energy and momentum.

- **Energy and Momentum:**  
  Photons have energy given by the equation:  
  > E = hν  
  where *h* is Planck’s constant and *ν* (nu) is the frequency of the light.  
  They also have momentum even though their rest mass is zero, following:  
  > p = E/c  
  This energy and momentum allow light to interact with matter and even be influenced by gravity.

### 2. Mass-Energy Equivalence and Light

- **Einstein’s Equation (E = mc²):**  
  According to Einstein’s famous equation, energy and mass are interchangeable. This means that the energy carried by a photon is equivalent to a certain amount of mass:
  
  > $m_equiv = E/c²$  
 
  This *equivalent mass* isn’t the same as the intrinsic mass (rest mass) that particles like electrons have. Rather, it’s a way of quantifying the energy of the photon in mass units. So while a photon is massless in terms of rest mass, its energy can be thought of as having a “mass equivalent.”

- **Gravitational Effects:**  
  Because light carries energy and momentum, it is affected by gravity. This is why light bends around massive objects—a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. The bending occurs because gravity curves spacetime, and photons travel along these curves, even though they don't have rest mass.
