**What Comes After One? A Tale of Order, Infinity, and Choice**

The question "What comes after one?" seems simple, but its answer unveils profound truths about mathematics, infinity, and the foundations of logic. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### **1. In the Real Numbers: No "Next" Number Exists**
- **Usual Ordering of Reals**: Between any two real numbers (e.g., 1 and 1.1), there are infinitely many others (1.01, 1.001, etc.). This **dense order** means there’s no immediate successor to 1.  
- **Why?** Real numbers are uncountably infinite and form a continuum. Unlike integers, which have discrete successors (2 follows 1), reals defy such simplicity.

### **2. Cantor’s Revolution: Well-Ordering and the Axiom of Choice**
- **Cantor’s Dream**: Georg Cantor sought to impose order on chaos. His *Well-Ordering Theorem* claimed *any set* (even uncountable ones like the reals) can be ordered so every subset has a "first" element.  
- **The Catch**: Cantor couldn’t prove it. Enter **Ernst Zermelo**, who used the **Axiom of Choice (AC)** to show:  
  - **AC Allows "Choosing"**: From infinitely many sets, you can pick one element each simultaneously, even with no rule.  
  - **Well-Ordering the Reals**: Using AC, Zermelo constructed an ordering where every real number *does* have a "next" number. But this order is **non-constructive**—we can’t write it down or visualize it.

### **3. Paradoxes of Choice: The Price of Order**
The axiom of choice enables powerful results but at a cost:  
- **Vitali Sets**: Non-measurable collections of numbers with no coherent length, defying basic geometry.  
- **Banach-Tarski Paradox**: A sphere can be split into 5 pieces, rotated, and reassembled into *two* identical spheres. These pieces are non-measurable "ghosts" of mathematics.  
- **Why Accept AC?** Despite paradoxes, AC is essential for modern math. It simplifies proofs in topology, analysis, and algebra. As mathematician Jerry Bona joked:  
  > *"The Axiom of Choice is obviously true, the Well-Ordering Theorem is obviously false, and who can tell about Zorn’s Lemma?"*

### **4. Gödel and Cohen: Freedom to Choose Your Math**
- **Independence Results**: Kurt Gödel (1938) and Paul Cohen (1963) proved AC is **independent** of standard set theory (ZF). You can:  
  - **Accept AC**: Embrace well-ordering, Vitali sets, and streamlined proofs.  
  - **Reject AC**: Work in a stricter universe where everything is "constructible," but lose key theorems.  
- **It’s a Choice**: Like choosing Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry, mathematicians pick axioms based on the math they want to do.

---

### **Final Answer**  
- **In the Standard Real Numbers**: Nothing comes immediately after 1—there’s always another number in between.  
- **With the Axiom of Choice**: A "next" number exists in a *non-constructive, well-ordered* sequence, but it bears no relation to the usual order.  

The axiom of choice bridges intuition and paradox, revealing mathematics as a tapestry of logic woven from axioms we choose to accept. As for what comes after one? It depends on the rules you play by.
