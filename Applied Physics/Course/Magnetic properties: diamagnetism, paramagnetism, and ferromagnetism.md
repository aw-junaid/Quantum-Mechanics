## **Magnetic Properties: Diamagnetism, Paramagnetism, and Ferromagnetism**

Magnetic properties of materials describe how they respond to an applied magnetic field. The response of a material depends on the **magnetic moment** of its atoms or molecules, which is caused by the motion of charged particles (mainly electrons) within the material. The three main categories of magnetic behavior are **diamagnetism**, **paramagnetism**, and **ferromagnetism**.

### **1. Diamagnetism**

#### **a) Definition**
- **Diamagnetism** is the property of materials that create an **opposing magnetic field** when exposed to an external magnetic field. These materials are **repelled** by magnetic fields.

#### **b) Atomic and Electronic Structure**
- In diamagnetic materials, all electrons are paired, and their individual magnetic moments cancel each other out. These materials do not have any net magnetic moment in the absence of an external field.
- When a magnetic field is applied, the electrons experience a **weak repulsive force** due to the **Lenz's Law**, which states that the induced current will oppose the change in the magnetic field.

#### **c) Magnetic Susceptibility**
- **Magnetic susceptibility** (χ) of diamagnetic materials is **negative** and very small (χ ≈ -10⁻⁶ to -10⁻⁴), meaning they are weakly repelled by the magnetic field.
  
#### **d) Examples**
- **Bismuth (Bi)**
- **Copper (Cu)**
- **Silver (Ag)**
- **Graphite**
- **Water**

#### **e) Applications**
- **Magnetic levitation**: Diamagnetic materials can be used in levitation applications because of their repulsive behavior against a magnetic field.
- **Magnetic shielding**: Diamagnetic materials can be used to shield sensitive equipment from external magnetic fields.

### **2. Paramagnetism**

#### **a) Definition**
- **Paramagnetism** is the property of materials that are **weakly attracted** to an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment of the material aligns with the applied field, but this effect is **very weak** and disappears once the external field is removed.

#### **b) Atomic and Electronic Structure**
- Paramagnetic materials have **unpaired electrons** in their atomic or molecular structure. These unpaired electrons create magnetic moments that tend to align with an external magnetic field.
- However, the alignment is **temporary** and only occurs when the magnetic field is applied. Once the external field is removed, the magnetic moments return to random orientations due to thermal motion.

#### **c) Magnetic Susceptibility**
- The **magnetic susceptibility** of paramagnetic materials is **positive**, but weak (χ ≈ +10⁻⁶ to +10⁻³). The attraction to the magnetic field is proportional to the strength of the field and is stronger at lower temperatures.

#### **d) Examples**
- **Aluminum (Al)**
- **Platinum (Pt)**
- **Oxygen (O₂)**
- **Tungsten (W)**

#### **e) Applications**
- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Paramagnetic substances are used in MRI contrast agents to enhance imaging.
- **Magnetic measurement**: Paramagnetic materials are used in devices that measure magnetic fields.

### **3. Ferromagnetism**

#### **a) Definition**
- **Ferromagnetism** is a property of materials that have a **strong magnetic response** to an external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials can be **magnetized permanently**, meaning they retain their magnetic moment even after the external magnetic field is removed.

#### **b) Atomic and Electronic Structure**
- In ferromagnetic materials, there are **unpaired electrons** that interact with each other to create **localized magnetic moments**. These moments tend to **align parallel to each other** even in the absence of an external magnetic field, creating a strong net magnetic moment.
- The alignment of magnetic moments occurs in **magnetic domains**, which are small regions where the magnetic moments of atoms are aligned in the same direction. When the domains align with the external field, the material becomes magnetized.

#### **c) Magnetic Susceptibility**
- The **magnetic susceptibility** of ferromagnetic materials is **very high**, and they can be strongly magnetized. The susceptibility can be in the range of 10³ to 10⁶, and the material may retain its magnetization once the external field is removed.

#### **d) Examples**
- **Iron (Fe)**
- **Nickel (Ni)**
- **Cobalt (Co)**
- **Alloys like Alnico and Neodymium magnets**

#### **e) Applications**
- **Permanent magnets**: Ferromagnetic materials are used to make permanent magnets, which are used in motors, loudspeakers, and magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard drives).
- **Transformers and electric motors**: Ferromagnetic materials are used in the core of transformers and electric motors to enhance efficiency by guiding magnetic fields.
- **Magnetic recording**: Used in hard drives, magnetic tapes, and other storage devices.

### **5. Summary**

- **Diamagnetism**: Weakly repels magnetic fields and does not retain magnetization. It is due to the paired electrons in the material and is seen in most materials to some degree.
- **Paramagnetism**: Weakly attracts magnetic fields but does not retain magnetization. It is due to the presence of unpaired electrons in the material.
- **Ferromagnetism**: Strongly attracts magnetic fields and can retain magnetization. It is due to the alignment of magnetic moments in **magnetic domains**, and it is the basis of permanent magnets and many electronic applications.

The differences in these magnetic properties are rooted in the **atomic structure** of the materials and the behavior of **electrons** within them, particularly the existence of **unpaired electrons** and the interaction of their magnetic moments.
