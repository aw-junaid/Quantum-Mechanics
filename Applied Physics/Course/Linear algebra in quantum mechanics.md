### **Linear Algebra in Quantum Mechanics**

Linear algebra plays a crucial role in **quantum mechanics** because the theory is fundamentally based on the properties of vector spaces and linear operators. In quantum mechanics, physical systems are described by state vectors, which belong to a **Hilbert space**, and the observables (such as energy, momentum, and position) are represented by **operators** that act on these state vectors. Below, we'll discuss the main concepts of linear algebra as they apply to quantum mechanics.

## **1. State Vectors and Hilbert Space**

In quantum mechanics, the state of a physical system is represented by a **state vector** $\( |\psi\rangle \)$, which belongs to a vector space known as a **Hilbert space**. This space is a complete inner product space, meaning it contains all the information needed to describe the quantum system.

### **a) Vector Space**
A **vector space** (or linear space) is a collection of vectors where you can add vectors and multiply them by scalars, satisfying certain properties such as commutativity, associativity, and the existence of a zero vector.

- **State Vectors**: A state vector $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ in quantum mechanics is a vector in a Hilbert space. The space could be finite-dimensional (for systems with discrete states) or infinite-dimensional (for systems with continuous states).

### **b) Inner Product**
The **inner product** in quantum mechanics is a way to define the "overlap" or "projection" of one state vector onto another. It is used to calculate probabilities and expected values of observables.

- The inner product between two state vectors $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ and $\( |\phi\rangle \)$ is written as $\( \langle \psi | \phi \rangle \)$. This is a complex number, and it represents the probability amplitude of transitioning from one state to another.

- **Normalization**: In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized so that $\( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1 \)$, meaning the probability of finding the system in the state $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ is 100%.

## **2. Operators and Observables**

In quantum mechanics, physical quantities such as position, momentum, and energy are represented by **operators**, which act on the state vectors. The result of applying an operator to a state vector is another state vector, or in the case of an observable, it may yield a scalar (a measurement).

### **a) Linear Operators**
An **operator** $\( \hat{A} \)$ is a mapping that takes a state vector $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ and produces another vector (or a scalar, in the case of an eigenvalue problem).

- **Example**: The **Hamiltonian operator** $\( \hat{H} \)$ represents the total energy of the system, and the **momentum operator** \( \hat{p} \) represents the momentum.

- **Mathematical Representation**: In the position basis, the momentum operator is represented as $\( \hat{p} = -i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \)$, where $\( \hbar \)$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

### **b) Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
Operators in quantum mechanics often have special solutions called **eigenvalues** and **eigenvectors**.

- If $\( \hat{A} |\psi\rangle = a |\psi\rangle \)$, then \( a \) is an **eigenvalue** of the operator $\( \hat{A} \)$, and $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ is the corresponding **eigenvector** (or eigenstate).

- In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of an operator correspond to the possible measurement outcomes of the associated observable.

- **Example**: If $\( \hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle \)$, the eigenvalue \( E \) represents a possible energy measurement of the system.

## **3. The Schrödinger Equation**

The **Schrödinger equation** is the fundamental equation in quantum mechanics that governs how quantum states evolve over time. It is a linear equation that involves the Hamiltonian operator \( \hat{H} \).

### **a) Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation**
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation describes how the state vector \( |\psi(t)\rangle \) evolves over time:

$\[
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H} |\psi(t)\rangle
\]$

Where:
- $\( \hat{H} \)$ is the **Hamiltonian operator** (representing the total energy of the system),
- $\( \hbar \)$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

### **b) Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation**
For stationary states (when the system’s energy is constant), the Schrödinger equation simplifies to the time-independent form:

$\[
\hat{H} |\psi\rangle = E |\psi\rangle
\]$

This equation is an eigenvalue equation, where the eigenvalue \( E \) corresponds to the energy of the system, and $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ is the wavefunction associated with that energy.

## **4. Measurement and the Born Rule**

In quantum mechanics, **measurements** are represented by the action of an operator on a state vector. When a measurement is made, the state vector collapses to one of the operator's eigenstates, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the result of the measurement.

### **a) Born Rule**
The **Born rule** gives the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue. If $\( |\psi\rangle \)$ is a normalized state vector and $\( \hat{A} \)$ is an observable operator with eigenvalues $\( a_n \)$ and corresponding eigenvectors $\( |\psi_n\rangle \)$, then the probability of measuring $\( a_n \)$ is given by:

$\[
P(a_n) = |\langle \psi_n | \psi \rangle|^2
\]$

This means the probability of obtaining a result $\( a_n \)$ is the square of the inner product of the state vector with the eigenstate corresponding to $\( a_n \)$.

## **5. Commutators and Uncertainty Principle**

In quantum mechanics, certain operators do not commute, meaning the order in which they are applied affects the outcome. This leads to important physical consequences, such as the **uncertainty principle**.

### **a) Commutators**
The **commutator** of two operators $\( \hat{A} \)$ and $\( \hat{B} \)$ is defined as:

$\[
[\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = \hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A}
\]$

If $\( [\hat{A}, \hat{B}] = 0 \)$, then the operators commute, meaning they have a common set of eigenstates. If $\( [\hat{A}, \hat{B}] \neq 0 \)$, the operators do not commute, meaning they cannot be simultaneously diagonalized, and there is an inherent uncertainty in their measurements.

### **b) Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**
The **Heisenberg uncertainty principle** is a direct consequence of the non-commutativity of certain operators, such as the position and momentum operators. It states that:

$\[
\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]$

Where $\( \Delta x \)$ is the uncertainty in position and $\( \Delta p \)$ is the uncertainty in momentum. This principle sets a fundamental limit on the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be measured simultaneously.

- **Operators**: Physical observables are represented by linear operators that act on state vectors.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Operators have eigenvalues (possible measurement outcomes) and eigenvectors (corresponding states).
- **Schrödinger Equation**: Describes how quantum states evolve over time, with the Hamiltonian operator dictating the evolution.
- **Commutators**: The non-commutativity of operators leads to phenomena like the uncertainty principle.
- **Born Rule**: The probability of a measurement outcome is given by the square of the overlap between the state vector and the corresponding eigenstate.

Linear algebra is foundational to quantum mechanics, providing the tools to analyze quantum states, operators, and their evolution, as well as to predict measurement outcomes and their probabilities.
