### **Work, Energy, and Power in Applied Physics**

#### **1. Work (W)**
In physics, **work** is done when a force is applied to an object, and the object moves in the direction of the applied force. 

##### **Mathematical Formula:**
$\[
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]$
where:
- $\( W \)$ = Work (Joules, J)  
- $\( F \)$ = Applied force (Newtons, N)  
- $\( d \)$ = Displacement (meters, m)  
- $\( \theta \)$ = Angle between force and displacement  

##### **Conditions for Work:**
- A force must be applied.
- The object must move.
- The displacement must have a component in the direction of the applied force.

##### **Types of Work:**
- **Positive Work** → When force and displacement are in the same direction (e.g., lifting an object).
- **Negative Work** → When force and displacement are in opposite directions (e.g., friction stopping a moving object).
- **Zero Work** → If displacement is zero or the force is perpendicular to displacement (e.g., carrying a bag while walking).

#### **2. Energy (E)**
**Energy** is the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, thermal energy, and more.

##### **Types of Energy:**
1. **Kinetic Energy (KE)** → Energy due to motion.  
   $\[
   KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
   \]$
   where \( m \) = mass (kg) and \( v \) = velocity (m/s).  

2. **Potential Energy (PE)** → Stored energy due to position.  
   $\[
   PE = m g h
   \]$
   where \( g \) = gravitational acceleration $(\(9.8 m/s^2\))$, and \( h \) = height (m).  

3. **Mechanical Energy** → Sum of kinetic and potential energy.  
   $\[
   ME = KE + PE
   \]$

4. **Other Forms:**  
   - Thermal energy (heat)
   - Chemical energy (in food and fuel)
   - Electrical energy (in circuits)
   - Nuclear energy (from atomic reactions)

##### **Law of Conservation of Energy:**  
Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.

---

#### **3. Power (P)**
**Power** is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

##### **Mathematical Formula:**
$\[
P = \frac{W}{t}
\]$
or  
$\[
P = F \cdot v
\]$
where:
- $\( P \)$ = Power (Watts, W)  
- $\( W \)$ = Work done (Joules, J)  
- $\( t \)$ = Time (seconds, s)  
- $\( v \)$ = Velocity (m/s)  

##### **Types of Power:**
- **Mechanical Power** → Power in physical systems (e.g., engines).  
- **Electrical Power** → Power in electrical circuits, given by:  
  $\[
  P = V I
  \]$
  where $\( V \)$ = voltage and $\( I \)$ = current.

##### **Units of Power:**
- **Watt (W)** → 1 Joule per second.
- **Horsepower (hp)** → Used for engines, where \( 1 hp = 746 W \).
