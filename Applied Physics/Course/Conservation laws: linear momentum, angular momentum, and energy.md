### **Conservation Laws in Physics**

Conservation laws are fundamental principles in physics stating that certain physical quantities remain constant in a closed system, meaning they cannot be created or destroyedâ€”only transformed or transferred.

## **1. Conservation of Linear Momentum**
**Linear momentum $(\(\vec{p}\))$** is the product of an objectâ€™s mass and velocity:
$\[
\vec{p} = m \vec{v}
\]$
where:
- \( m \) = mass of the object (kg)  
- $\( \vec{v} \)$ = velocity of the object (m/s)  

### **Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum**
> "The total linear momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external force acts on it."

### **Mathematical Representation:**
For two interacting objects:
$\[
m_1 v_{1i} + m_2 v_{2i} = m_1 v_{1f} + m_2 v_{2f}
\]$
where:
- $\( v_{i} \)$ and $\( v_{f} \)$ are initial and final velocities.

### **Examples:**
- **Collision of billiard balls:** Momentum before and after the collision is conserved.
- **Rocket propulsion:** Gases ejected from the rocket exert an equal and opposite force on the rocket, propelling it forward (Newtonâ€™s Third Law).

## **2. Conservation of Angular Momentum**
**Angular momentum $(\(\vec{L}\))$** is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum:
$\[
\vec{L} = I \vec{\omega}
\]$
where:
- $\( I \)$ = moment of inertia (kgÂ·mÂ²)  
- $\( \vec{\omega} \) = angular velocity (rad/s)$  

### **Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum**
> "The total angular momentum of a system remains constant if no external torque acts on it."

### **Mathematical Representation:**
$\[
I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f
\]$

### **Examples:**
- **Figure skater spinning:** When a skater pulls in their arms, their moment of inertia decreases, and angular velocity increases (spins faster).
- **Planetary motion:** Planets orbiting the Sun maintain constant angular momentum, moving faster when closer to the Sun and slower when farther away (Keplerâ€™s Second Law).

## **3. Conservation of Energy**
**Energy (\(E\))** is the ability to do work. It exists in various forms (kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, etc.).

### **Law of Conservation of Energy**
> "The total energy in an isolated system remains constant; it can change forms but cannot be created or destroyed."

### **Mathematical Representation:**
$\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
\]$
For mechanical energy (kinetic + potential):
$\[
KE_i + PE_i = KE_f + PE_f
\]$

### **Examples:**
- **Pendulum motion:** Converts potential energy to kinetic energy and vice versa.
- **Roller coaster:** At the highest point, it has maximum potential energy; as it descends, it converts to kinetic energy.
- **Electrical circuits:** Electrical energy converts to light and heat in a bulb.

### **Conclusion**
1. **Linear momentum** is conserved when no external force acts.
2. **Angular momentum** is conserved when no external torque is applied.
3. **Energy** remains constant but transforms between different types.

These conservation laws are fundamental to physics and engineering, governing motion, collisions, planetary orbits, and energy transformations in real-world applications. ðŸš€
