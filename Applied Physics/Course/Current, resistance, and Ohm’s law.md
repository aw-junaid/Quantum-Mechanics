# **Current, Resistance, and Ohm’s Law**  

## **1. Electric Current (\( I \))**  
Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor.

### **Mathematical Definition:**
$\[
I = \frac{Q}{t}
\]$
where:  
- \( I \) = Current (Amperes, A),  
- \( Q \) = Charge (Coulombs, C),  
- \( t \) = Time (seconds, s).  

### **Types of Current:**
1. **Direct Current (DC)** – Charge flows in one direction (e.g., batteries).  
2. **Alternating Current (AC)** – Charge direction alternates periodically (e.g., household electricity).  

---

## **2. Resistance (\( R \))**  
Resistance opposes the flow of current in a material.

### **Mathematical Definition:**
$\[
R = \frac{V}{I}
\]$
where:  
- \( R \) = Resistance (Ohms, $\( \Omega \))$,  
- \( V \) = Voltage (Volts, V),  
- \( I \) = Current (Amperes, A).  

### **Factors Affecting Resistance:**
$\[
R = \rho \frac{L}{A}
\]$
where:  
- $\( \rho \)$ = Resistivity of the material $(\(\Omega\)-m)$,  
- \( L \) = Length of the conductor (m),  
- \( A \) = Cross-sectional area (m²).  

**Key Observations:**
- **Longer wire** → Higher resistance.  
- **Thicker wire** → Lower resistance.  
- **Material-dependent**: Copper has low resistivity, rubber has high resistivity.

---

## **3. Ohm’s Law**  
Ohm’s Law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.

$\[
V = IR
\]$

### **Key Implications:**
- If **voltage increases**, current increases (if \( R \) is constant).  
- If **resistance increases**, current decreases (if \( V \) is constant).  

---

## **4. Power in Electrical Circuits**  
Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted.

$\[
P = VI
\]$

Using **Ohm’s Law**, other forms are:

$\[
P = I^2 R
\]$

$\[
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
\]$

where \( P \) is in **Watts (W)**.

---

## **5. Series and Parallel Circuits**  

### **(A) Resistors in Series**
$\[
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \dots
\]$
- **Same current** flows through all resistors.  
- **Voltage divides** across each resistor.  

### **(B) Resistors in Parallel**
$\[
\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \dots
\]$
- **Same voltage** across all resistors.  
- **Current divides** among the branches.  

---

## **6. Applications of Ohm’s Law**  
- **Designing electrical circuits**.  
- **Selecting proper resistors** for devices.  
- **Calculating power consumption** (e.g., home appliances).  

---

## **Conclusion**  
- **Current** is the flow of charge.  
- **Resistance** opposes current.  
- **Ohm’s Law** relates voltage, current, and resistance.  
- **Power formulas** describe energy consumption.  

These principles are crucial in **electronics, electrical engineering, and power distribution**! ⚡
