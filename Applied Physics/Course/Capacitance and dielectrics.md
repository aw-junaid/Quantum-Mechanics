# **Capacitance and Dielectrics**  

## **1. Capacitance**  
Capacitance measures the ability of a system to store electric charge. It is defined as the ratio of charge stored to the potential difference across the conductors.

### **Mathematical Definition**  
$\[
C = \frac{Q}{V}
\]$
where:  
- \( C \) = Capacitance (Farads, F),  
- \( Q \) = Charge stored on the capacitor (Coulombs, C),  
- \( V \) = Voltage across the plates (Volts, V).  

A **capacitor** is a device designed to store charge and energy in an electric field.

## **2. Capacitance of Different Capacitors**  

### **(A) Parallel Plate Capacitor**  
For a capacitor with two parallel plates of area \( A \), separated by distance \( d \):

$\[
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
\]$

where:  
- $\( \epsilon_0 \) = Permittivity of free space (\( 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \) C²/N·m²)$,  
- \( A \) = Plate area (m²),  
- \( d \) = Separation distance (m).  

**Key Takeaways:**
- Larger plate area (\( A \)) → **higher capacitance**.
- Greater separation distance (\( d \)) → **lower capacitance**.

---

### **(B) Spherical Capacitor**  
For a capacitor with inner radius $\( R_1 \)$ and outer radius $\( R_2 \)$:

$\[
C = \frac{4\pi \epsilon_0 R_1 R_2}{R_2 - R_1}
\]$

---

### **(C) Cylindrical Capacitor**  
For a capacitor formed by two coaxial cylinders:

$\[
C = \frac{2\pi \epsilon_0 L}{\ln(R_2/R_1)}
\]$

where:  
- \( L \) = Length of the cylinder,  
- $\( R_1 \)$, $\( R_2 \)$ = Inner and outer radii.

---

## **3. Energy Stored in a Capacitor**  
A charged capacitor stores electric potential energy given by:

$\[
U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
\]$

Since $\( Q = CV \)$, other forms of this equation are:

$\[
U = \frac{1}{2} Q V = \frac{Q^2}{2C}
\]$

---

## **4. Capacitors in Series and Parallel**  

### **(A) Capacitors in Parallel**  
$\[
C_{\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \dots
\]$
- **Total capacitance increases**.
- Same **voltage** across each capacitor.

### **(B) Capacitors in Series**  
$\[
\frac{1}{C_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3} + \dots
\]$
- **Total capacitance decreases**.
- Same **charge** stored on each capacitor.

---

## **5. Dielectrics**  
A **dielectric** is an insulating material placed between capacitor plates to **increase capacitance** by reducing the electric field.

### **Dielectric Constant (\( k \))**  
A dielectric increases capacitance by a factor \( k \):

$\[
C' = k C_0
\]$

where:
- $\( C' \)$ = New capacitance with dielectric,  
- $\( C_0 \)$ = Capacitance without dielectric,  
- \( k \) = Dielectric constant $(always \( k > 1 \))$.  

### **Effects of a Dielectric**
1. **Increases capacitance**:  
   $\[
   C = \frac{k \epsilon_0 A}{d}
   \]$
2. **Reduces electric field** inside the capacitor:
   $\[
   E' = \frac{E_0}{k}
   \]$
3. **Stores more energy** for the same voltage.

### **Common Dielectric Materials and Their Constants**
| Material | Dielectric Constant $(\( k \))$ |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Vacuum | 1.0 |
| Air | 1.0006 |
| Glass | 4-7 |
| Water | 80 |
| Mica | 3-7 |

## **6. Breakdown Voltage and Polarization**  
- **Dielectric Breakdown**: When a dielectric **fails** under high voltage, it starts conducting.  
- **Polarization**: Dielectric molecules align in response to the electric field, reducing the field strength inside.

---

## **7. Applications of Capacitors**  
- **Energy storage** (batteries, power banks).  
- **Filtering signals** in electronics.  
- **Tuning circuits** (radio, TV).  
- **Flash cameras** (quick energy discharge).  

---

## **Conclusion**  
- **Capacitance** measures charge storage ability.  
- **Parallel plate capacitors** depend on plate area and separation.  
- **Dielectrics** increase capacitance by reducing the field.  
- **Capacitors store energy** and are widely used in electronics.
