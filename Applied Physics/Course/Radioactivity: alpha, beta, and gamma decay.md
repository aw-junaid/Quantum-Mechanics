## **Radioactivity: Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Decay**

**Radioactivity** is the spontaneous emission of radiation from an unstable atomic nucleus. This process occurs when an atom’s nucleus undergoes a transformation to achieve a more stable configuration, emitting one or more types of radiation. The three most common types of radioactive decay are **alpha decay**, **beta decay**, and **gamma decay**. Each type of decay involves different particles and has different properties and effects.

### **1. Alpha Decay (α-decay)**

#### **a) Description**
- **Alpha decay** occurs when an unstable nucleus releases an **alpha particle**. An alpha particle consists of **2 protons and 2 neutrons**, which is essentially the nucleus of a helium-4 atom.
- This type of decay typically occurs in **heavy elements** (e.g., uranium-238, radium-226), as they are more likely to have too many protons and neutrons to be stable.
  
#### **b) Process**
- During alpha decay, the parent nucleus loses 2 protons and 2 neutrons, forming a **daughter nucleus**.
  
  The general equation for alpha decay is:
  $\[
  \text{Parent nucleus} \rightarrow \text{Daughter nucleus} + \alpha \, (\text{helium-4 particle})
  \]$
  
- Example: 
  $\[
  \text{Uranium-238 (U)} \rightarrow \text{Thorium-234 (Th)} + \alpha
  \]$

#### **c) Properties of Alpha Particles**
- Alpha particles have a **charge of +2** and a **mass of 4 amu** (similar to a helium nucleus).
- **Alpha particles** are **heavier** and **less penetrating** than other forms of radiation, and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or even human skin.
- However, if alpha-emitting substances are inhaled or ingested, they can be highly dangerous due to their **ionizing** ability.

### **2. Beta Decay (β-decay)**

#### **a) Description**
- **Beta decay** involves the transformation of a **neutron** into a **proton** or vice versa within the nucleus, and the emission of a **beta particle**. There are two types of beta decay: **beta-minus (β⁻)** and **beta-plus (β⁺)**.

#### **b) Beta Minus Decay (β⁻ decay)**
- In **beta-minus decay**, a **neutron** in the nucleus decays into a **proton**, and an **electron (beta particle)** and an **antineutrino** are emitted.
  
  The equation for beta-minus decay is:
  $\[
  \text{Neutron} \rightarrow \text{Proton} + \beta^- + \bar{\nu}_e
  \]$
  
- Example:
  $\[
  \text{Carbon-14 (C)} \rightarrow \text{Nitrogen-14 (N)} + \beta^- + \bar{\nu}_e
  \]$
  
#### **c) Beta Plus Decay (β⁺ decay)**
- In **beta-plus decay**, a **proton** in the nucleus decays into a **neutron**, and a **positron** (a particle with the same mass as an electron but a positive charge) and a **neutrino** are emitted.

  The equation for beta-plus decay is:
  $\[
  \text{Proton} \rightarrow \text{Neutron} + \beta^+ + \nu_e
  \]$
  
- Example:
  $\[
  \text{Sodium-22 (Na)} \rightarrow \text{Neon-22 (Ne)} + \beta^+ + \nu_e
  \]$
  
#### **d) Properties of Beta Particles**
- **Beta particles** are **high-energy, high-speed electrons** (β⁻) or **positrons** (β⁺) that are emitted from the nucleus during the decay process.
- **Beta particles** have much **greater penetrating power** than alpha particles and can pass through paper or skin but are stopped by materials like plastic or glass.
- Beta decay also changes the atomic number of the nucleus by **±1** (depending on the type of beta decay), which results in the formation of a different element.

### **3. Gamma Decay (γ-decay)**

#### **a) Description**
- **Gamma decay** involves the emission of **gamma rays** (high-energy electromagnetic radiation) from an excited nucleus. Gamma rays are often emitted following **alpha** or **beta decay**, as the nucleus moves to a lower energy state.
  
- Gamma decay does not alter the number of protons or neutrons in the nucleus, so it does not change the element. It simply releases excess energy from the nucleus in the form of gamma radiation.
  
#### **b) Process**
- In gamma decay, a nucleus in an **excited state** emits a **gamma photon** (a high-energy photon) to transition to a **lower energy state**.
  
  The general equation for gamma decay is:
  $\[
  \text{Excited nucleus} \rightarrow \text{Ground state nucleus} + \gamma
  \]$

- Example:
  $\[
  \text{Cobalt-60 (Co)} \rightarrow \text{Cobalt-60 (Co)} + \gamma
  \]$
  (This process follows beta decay in cobalt-60, where a beta particle is emitted, followed by gamma radiation to release excess energy.)

#### **c) Properties of Gamma Rays**
- Gamma rays are **electromagnetic waves** (like X-rays) with **no mass** and **no charge**.
- Gamma radiation has extremely **high penetrating power** and can pass through many materials, requiring thick lead or concrete to effectively shield against it.
- Gamma radiation is highly **ionizing** and can be harmful to living tissues, which is why proper shielding is important when dealing with gamma-emitting substances.

### **5. Summary**

- **Alpha Decay**: Releases an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) and reduces the mass and atomic number of the parent nucleus.
- **Beta Decay**: Involves the transformation of a neutron to a proton (β⁻) or a proton to a neutron (β⁺), emitting an electron or positron.
- **Gamma Decay**: Involves the emission of high-energy gamma rays to release excess energy from the nucleus, without changing the composition of the nucleus.

Radioactive decay plays a crucial role in both natural processes and practical applications, including medicine, energy generation, and scientific research. However, the ionizing nature of radiation requires careful management and protection.
