# **Electrostatics: Coulomb's Law, Electric Field, and Electric Potential**  

Electrostatics deals with the study of electric charges at rest and the forces, fields, and potentials associated with them.

---

## **1. Coulomb’s Law**  
Coulomb’s Law describes the force between two point charges.

### **Mathematical Formula:**
$\[
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
\]$
where:
- \( F \) = Electrostatic force (Newton, N),
- \( k \) = Coulomb’s constant $(\( 8.99 \times 10^9 \) N·m²/C²)$,
- $\( q_1, q_2 \)$ = Magnitudes of the two charges (Coulombs, C),
- \( r \) = Distance between charges (meters, m).

### **Properties:**
- The force is **attractive** if the charges are opposite $(\(+q\)$ and \(-q\)).
- The force is **repulsive** if the charges are similar $(\(+q\)$ and $\(+q\)$ or \(-q\) and \(-q\)).
- The force acts along the line joining the charges.

### **Example:**
If two charges of $\( +2\ \mu C \)$ and $\( -3\ \mu C \)$ are 0.5 m apart, the force between them is:

$\[
F = \left( 8.99 \times 10^9 \right) \times \frac{(2 \times 10^{-6}) (3 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.5)^2}
\]$

$\[
F = 0.2158 \text{ N} \quad (\text{attractive force})
\]$

## **2. Electric Field $(\(\mathbf{E}\))$**  
The **electric field** is the force per unit charge experienced by a small positive test charge placed in a field.

### **Mathematical Formula:**
$\[
E = \frac{F}{q} = k \frac{Q}{r^2}
\]$
where:
- \( E \) = Electric field (N/C),
- \( F \) = Force experienced by charge \( q \) (N),
- \( Q \) = Source charge (C),
- \( r \) = Distance from the source charge (m).

### **Electric Field Lines:**
- Point **away** from positive charges.
- Point **toward** negative charges.
- Closer lines = Stronger field.
- Never cross each other.

### **Example:**
If a charge $\( Q = +5\ \mu C \)$ creates an electric field at 2 m distance, the field strength is:

$\[
E = (8.99 \times 10^9) \times \frac{5 \times 10^{-6}}{2^2}
\]$

$\[
E = 11237.5 \text{ N/C}
\]$

---

## **3. Electric Potential (\(V\))**  
Electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

### **Mathematical Formula:**
$\[
V = k \frac{Q}{r}
\]$
where:
- \( V \) = Electric potential (Volts, V),
- \( Q \) = Source charge (C),
- \( r \) = Distance from the charge (m).

### **Electric Potential Difference (Voltage):**
The **potential difference** between two points is the work done in moving a unit charge between them:

$\[
V = \frac{W}{q}
\]$

### **Example:**
If a $\( +3\ \mu C \)$ charge is placed 0.5 m from a source charge $\( Q = +6\ \mu C \)$, the potential is:

$\[
V = (8.99 \times 10^9) \times \frac{6 \times 10^{-6}}{0.5}
\]$

$\[
V = 107880 \text{ V}
\]$

## **Key Differences Between Electric Field and Electric Potential**
| Property | Electric Field $(\(\mathbf{E}\))$ | Electric Potential (\(V\)) |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Definition | Force per unit charge | Energy per unit charge |
| Formula | $\( E = k \frac{Q}{r^2} \)$ | $\( V = k \frac{Q}{r} \)$ |
| Units | N/C or V/m | Volts (V) |
| Type | Vector (has direction) | Scalar (no direction) |
