## **1. Fourier Series: Decomposition of Periodic Functions**

A **Fourier series** is a way to represent a **periodic function** as an infinite sum of **sine** and **cosine** functions. This approach allows us to analyze the frequency content of periodic signals, making it an essential tool in many areas of physics and engineering.

### **a) Fourier Series Representation**

For a periodic function $\( f(t) \)$ with period \( T \), the Fourier series representation is given by:

$\[
f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left( \frac{2\pi n t}{T} \right) + b_n \sin\left( \frac{2\pi n t}{T} \right) \right)
\]$

Where:
- $\( a_0 \)$ is the **average value** (DC component) of the function,
- $\( a_n \)$ and $\( b_n \)$ are the Fourier coefficients, which are calculated as:
  
  $\[
  a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \cos\left( \frac{2\pi n t}{T} \right) dt
  \]$
  
  $\[
  b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2\pi n t}{T} \right) dt
  \]$

- The sum represents the function $\( f(t) \)$ as a combination of sine and cosine waves with specific frequencies $\( \frac{n}{T} \)$.

### **b) Application of Fourier Series**
- **Signal Processing**: Fourier series is used to analyze periodic signals, such as sound waves, radio signals, and alternating current (AC) voltages.
- **Vibration Analysis**: In mechanical systems, periodic motions can be decomposed into sinusoidal components to study vibrations.
- **Image Compression**: Fourier series is used in image processing to represent image patterns as a sum of sinusoidal waves.

## **2. Fourier Transform: Decomposition of Non-Periodic Functions**

While the **Fourier series** works for periodic functions, the **Fourier transform** generalizes the idea to **non-periodic functions** or signals, allowing them to be represented as a continuous sum of sinusoidal functions with a continuous frequency spectrum.

### **a) Fourier Transform Definition**

For a given function $\( f(t) \)$ defined for all time \( t \), its Fourier transform $\( \hat{f}(\omega) \)$ is given by:

$\[
\hat{f}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i\omega t} dt
\]$

Where:
- $\( \omega \)$ is the angular frequency $(\( \omega = 2\pi f \))$,
- $\( \hat{f}(\omega) \)$ is the **frequency spectrum** of the function $\( f(t) \)$.

The inverse Fourier transform allows you to recover the original function from its frequency spectrum:

$\[
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\omega) e^{i\omega t} d\omega
\]$

### **b) Properties of Fourier Transforms**
- **Linearity**: The Fourier transform of a sum of functions is the sum of their Fourier transforms.
- **Time-Frequency Duality**: A function that is narrow in time will have a wide frequency spectrum and vice versa.
- **Shift Theorem**: Shifting a function in time results in a phase shift in the frequency domain.

## **3. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**

In practical applications, especially in digital signal processing (DSP), the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** is used to analyze discrete signals sampled at fixed intervals.

### **a) DFT Definition**

For a sequence of \( N \) data points $\( f[n] \)$ (where $\( n = 0, 1, 2, \dots, N-1 \))$, the DFT is given by:

$\[
F[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f[n] e^{-i 2\pi k n / N}
\]$

Where:
- $\( F[k] \)$ represents the Fourier coefficient at the \( k \)-th frequency,
- $\( f[n] \)$ is the signal sampled at discrete time intervals.

### **b) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**

The **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is an efficient algorithm for computing the **DFT** in $\( O(N \log N) \)$ time, significantly reducing the computational cost compared to direct calculation of the DFT. It is widely used in real-time applications such as signal processing, audio analysis, and image processing.

### **a) Signal Processing**
- **Filtering**: Fourier analysis is used to design filters that remove unwanted frequencies from signals, such as noise filtering in audio or communication systems.
- **Compression**: Data compression techniques, such as JPEG (for images) and MP3 (for audio), use Fourier transforms to represent data efficiently by discarding frequencies that are less perceptible to humans.

### **b) Heat Equation and Diffusion Problems**
- Fourier transforms are used to solve the **heat equation**, which describes the distribution of heat in a solid over time. By transforming the problem into the frequency domain, it becomes easier to solve.

### **c) Quantum Mechanics**
- In quantum mechanics, the **wave function** of a particle is often expressed as a superposition of plane waves (via Fourier analysis). The **momentum representation** of a particle's state can be derived using the Fourier transform.

### **d) Optics**
- Fourier optics uses Fourier transforms to study the diffraction and interference patterns of light. It helps in designing optical systems such as lenses and microscopes.

### **e) Vibrations and Acoustics**
- The study of mechanical vibrations in systems like strings, membranes, and beams often involves Fourier analysis to break down complex oscillations into simpler modes of vibration (resonant frequencies).
- **Sound Waves**: Fourier analysis is used to study the frequency content of sound waves, crucial in fields such as acoustics, music, and speech processing.

### **f) Imaging and Medical Applications**
- Fourier techniques are used in imaging systems, including **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** and **CT scans**, where the image reconstruction relies on Fourier transforms to convert data from frequency space to spatial space.
