Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, vector spaces (or linear spaces), linear transformations, and systems of linear equations. It provides a framework for analyzing and solving problems involving linear relationships. Linear algebra is foundational in many areas of mathematics and is widely used in fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, economics, and statistics.

### Key Concepts in Linear Algebra

1. **Vectors and Vector Spaces**:
   - **Vectors**: A vector is an element of a vector space, often represented as an ordered list of numbers (coordinates). Vectors can be added together and multiplied by scalars (numbers).
   - **Vector Space**: A vector space is a collection of vectors that can be scaled and added together while satisfying certain axioms (closure, associativity, commutativity, etc.).

2. **Matrices**:
   - **Matrix**: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations and systems of linear equations.
   - **Matrix Operations**: Basic operations include matrix addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, and finding the transpose of a matrix.

3. **Systems of Linear Equations**:
   - **Linear System**: A system of linear equations is a set of equations where each equation is linear. Linear systems can be represented using matrices and solved using methods such as Gaussian elimination or matrix inversion.

4. **Determinants**:
   - **Determinant**: The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix. It provides information about the matrix, such as whether it is invertible (non-singular) or singular (non-invertible). The determinant also has geometric interpretations related to volume and orientation.

5. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:
   - **Eigenvalue**: An eigenvalue of a matrix is a scalar value $\(\lambda\)$ for which there exists a non-zero vector $\(v\)$ (eigenvector) such that $\(A v = \lambda v\)$, where $\(A\)$ is the matrix.
   - **Eigenvector**: An eigenvector is a non-zero vector that changes only in scale when a linear transformation is applied to it.

6. **Linear Transformations**:
   - **Linear Transformation**: A linear transformation is a function that maps vectors from one vector space to another while preserving vector addition and scalar multiplication. Linear transformations can be represented by matrices.

7. **Rank and Nullity**:
   - **Rank**: The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by its rows or columns. It represents the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.
   - **Nullity**: The nullity of a matrix is the dimension of the kernel (null space) of the matrix, which consists of all vectors that are mapped to the zero vector.

8. **Orthogonality**:
   - **Orthogonal Vectors**: Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero. Orthogonality is important in various applications, including orthogonal projections and orthogonal matrices.
   - **Orthogonal Matrix**: An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose rows and columns are orthonormal vectors. An orthogonal matrix satisfies $\(A^T A = A A^T = I\)$, where $\(A^T\)$ is the transpose of \(A\) and \(I\) is the identity matrix.

### Common Methods and Theorems

1. **Gaussian Elimination**:
   - A method for solving systems of linear equations by transforming the matrix into row echelon form using row operations.

2. **Matrix Inversion**:
   - Finding the inverse of a matrix (if it exists) such that $(\(A^{-1} A = I\))$, where $(\(I\))$ is the identity matrix.

3. **LU Decomposition**:
   - Decomposing a matrix \(A\) into the product of a lower triangular matrix \(L\) and an upper triangular matrix \(U\), used for solving linear systems and computing determinants.

4. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:
   - Decomposing a matrix into the product of three matrices: $\(A = U \Sigma V^T\)$, where \(U\) and \(V\) are orthogonal matrices and $\(\Sigma\)$ is a diagonal matrix. SVD is used in many applications, including dimensionality reduction and data compression.

5. **Spectral Theorem**:
   - States that any symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by an orthogonal matrix. This theorem is fundamental in understanding the properties of symmetric matrices and their eigenvalues.

### Applications of Linear Algebra

1. **Computer Graphics**:
   - Linear algebra is used in computer graphics for transformations, including translation, rotation, and scaling of objects.

2. **Machine Learning and Data Science**:
   - Linear algebra is foundational in machine learning algorithms, including regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and neural networks.

3. **Engineering**:
   - Linear algebra is applied in various engineering fields for solving systems of equations, optimizing designs, and analyzing mechanical systems.

4. **Physics**:
   - Linear algebra is used in quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and other areas of physics to describe physical systems and solve related equations.

5. **Economics and Optimization**:
   - Linear algebra is used in economics for modeling and solving optimization problems, including resource allocation and cost minimization.

Linear algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics concerned with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. It provides tools for solving systems of linear equations, analyzing vector spaces, and understanding various mathematical and physical phenomena.
