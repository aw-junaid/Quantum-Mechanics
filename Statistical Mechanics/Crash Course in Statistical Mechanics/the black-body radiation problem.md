The black-body radiation problem was a significant issue in physics at the end of the 19th century, leading to the development of quantum mechanics. It involved understanding how an idealized object (a "black body") emits electromagnetic radiation and how this radiation depends on temperature.

### What is Black-Body Radiation?

A black body is an idealized object that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. When a black body is heated, it emits radiation with a characteristic spectrum that depends only on its temperature. This radiation is known as black-body radiation.

### The Problem: Ultraviolet Catastrophe

Classical physics, particularly the laws of thermodynamics and electromagnetism, was unable to explain the observed spectrum of black-body radiation. The problem was that classical theories predicted that a black body would emit infinite amounts of energy at high frequencies, leading to what became known as the **ultraviolet catastrophe**.

#### Classical Approach: Rayleigh-Jeans Law

The classical approach, using the principles of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics, was developed by Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans. According to this theory, the energy density $\( u(\nu, T) \)$ of radiation at a frequency $\( \nu \)$ and temperature \( T \) is given by:

$\[
u(\nu, T) = \frac{8 \pi \nu^2}{c^3} k_B T
\]$

where:
- $\( \nu \)$ is the frequency of the radiation,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- $\( k_B \)$ is Boltzmann's constant,
- \( T \) is the absolute temperature.

While the Rayleigh-Jeans law matched experimental data at low frequencies, it failed dramatically at high frequencies, predicting an infinite amount of energy as $\( \nu \)$ increases. This divergence, especially in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, was the "ultraviolet catastrophe."

### Planck's Solution

In 1900, Max Planck resolved the black-body radiation problem by introducing a revolutionary idea: energy is not emitted continuously but in discrete packets or "quanta." This was the birth of quantum theory.

#### Planck's Law

Planck proposed that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized and proportional to its frequency:

$\[
E = h \nu
\]$

where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the radiation,
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,
- $\( \nu \)$ is the frequency of the radiation.

Using this assumption, Planck derived a new formula for the energy density of black-body radiation:

$\[
u(\nu, T) = \frac{8 \pi \nu^2}{c^3} \cdot \frac{h \nu}{e^{h \nu / k_B T} - 1}
\]$

This formula, known as Planck's law, accurately described the observed spectrum of black-body radiation at all frequencies. It successfully explained the drop-off in radiation intensity at high frequencies, avoiding the ultraviolet catastrophe.

### Implications and Significance

1. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   - Planck's hypothesis that energy is quantized was a radical departure from classical physics and marked the beginning of quantum mechanics. It introduced the concept of quantized energy levels, which later played a crucial role in the development of atomic and molecular physics.

2. **Planck's Constant**:
   - The introduction of Planck's constant $\( h \)$ became fundamental to quantum theory, appearing in key equations such as the Schr√∂dinger equation and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

3. **Einstein and the Photoelectric Effect**:
   - In 1905, Albert Einstein expanded on Planck's idea by explaining the photoelectric effect using quantized light particles (photons). This work further solidified the concept of energy quantization and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

4. **Spectroscopy and Cosmology**:
   - Planck's law is crucial in various fields, including spectroscopy, where it helps understand the emission and absorption of light by atoms and molecules. It is also vital in cosmology, particularly in the study of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is a near-perfect black-body spectrum.

### Summary

The black-body radiation problem was a critical issue that classical physics could not solve, leading to the ultraviolet catastrophe. Max Planck's introduction of energy quantization provided a solution, marking the beginning of quantum mechanics. Planck's law accurately described the spectrum of black-body radiation and laid the foundation for much of modern physics, profoundly impacting our understanding of energy, light, and the quantum nature of reality.
