Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This process transforms the original atom, called the parent nuclide, into a different atom, known as the daughter nuclide. Radioactive decay is a spontaneous process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics, and it plays a significant role in nuclear physics, chemistry, and various applications such as radiometric dating, medical imaging, and nuclear energy.

### Types of Radioactive Decay

There are several primary types of radioactive decay, each characterized by the type of particles or radiation emitted:

1. **Alpha Decay (α-decay)**:
   - In alpha decay, the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons (essentially a helium-4 nucleus).
   - Example: Uranium-238 decays into Thorium-234 by emitting an alpha particle:
     $\[
     {}^{238}_{92}\text{U} \rightarrow {}^{234}_{90}\text{Th} + {}^{4}_{2}\text{He}
     \]$
   - Alpha particles have low penetration power and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or skin.

2. **Beta Decay (β-decay)**:
   - **Beta-minus decay (β⁻ decay)**: In this process, a neutron is converted into a proton, and the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino.
     $\[
     {}^{14}_{6}\text{C} \rightarrow {}^{14}_{7}\text{N} + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e
     \]$
   - **Beta-plus decay (β⁺ decay)**: Here, a proton is converted into a neutron, and the nucleus emits a positron (the electron's antiparticle) and a neutrino.
     $\[
     {}^{11}_{6}\text{C} \rightarrow {}^{11}_{5}\text{B} + e^+ + \nu_e
     \]$
   - Beta particles have greater penetration power than alpha particles but can be stopped by materials like plastic or glass.

3. **Gamma Decay (γ-decay)**:
   - Gamma decay involves the emission of gamma rays, which are high-energy photons. This often occurs after alpha or beta decay when the daughter nucleus is in an excited state and releases energy to reach a lower energy state.
   - Example: Cobalt-60 emits gamma radiation after beta decay:
     $\[
     {}^{60}_{27}\text{Co} \rightarrow {}^{60}_{28}\text{Ni}^* + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e
     \]$
     $\[
     {}^{60}_{28}\text{Ni}^* \rightarrow {}^{60}_{28}\text{Ni} + \gamma
     \]$
   - Gamma rays have high penetration power and can pass through most materials, requiring dense substances like lead for shielding.

4. **Positron Emission**:
   - Positron emission is a form of beta-plus decay where a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino.
   - Example: Fluorine-18 decays into Oxygen-18 by positron emission:
     $\[
     {}^{18}_{9}\text{F} \rightarrow {}^{18}_{8}\text{O} + e^+ + \nu_e
     \]$

5. **Electron Capture**:
   - In electron capture, an inner orbital electron is captured by the nucleus, where it combines with a proton to form a neutron and a neutrino.
   - Example: Potassium-40 can decay via electron capture:
     $\[
     {}^{40}_{19}\text{K} + e^- \rightarrow {}^{40}_{18}\text{Ar} + \nu_e
     \]$

6. **Spontaneous Fission**:
   - Some heavy nuclei can undergo spontaneous fission, splitting into two or more lighter nuclei and releasing a large amount of energy and neutrons.
   - Example: Californium-252 can spontaneously fission into various smaller nuclei.

### Decay Law and Half-Life

Radioactive decay is a random process for individual atoms, but it follows a predictable pattern when considering large numbers of atoms. The decay rate is described by the decay constant $\( \lambda \)$, and the number of undecayed nuclei $\( N(t) \)$ at time $\( t \)$ is given by the exponential decay law:

$\[
N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}
\]$

where $\( N_0 \)$ is the initial number of nuclei, and $\( \lambda \)$ is the decay constant.

- **Half-Life**: The half-life $\( T_{1/2} \)$ is the time required for half of the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. It is related to the decay constant by:
  $\[
  T_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}
  \]$

### Applications of Radioactive Decay

1. **Radiometric Dating**:
   - By measuring the ratio of parent to daughter isotopes in a sample and knowing the half-life, scientists can estimate the age of materials (e.g., carbon-14 dating).

2. **Medical Imaging and Treatment**:
   - Radioisotopes are used in medical diagnostics (e.g., PET scans using fluorine-18) and in treatment (e.g., iodine-131 for treating thyroid conditions).

3. **Nuclear Power**:
   - The energy released during radioactive decay is harnessed in nuclear reactors to produce electricity.

4. **Scientific Research**:
   - Understanding radioactive decay helps in studying the properties of atomic nuclei and the fundamental forces governing their behavior.

### Summary

Radioactive decay is the process by which unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation, transforming into more stable nuclei. This process is crucial for understanding nuclear physics, with important applications in dating, medicine, energy production, and scientific research. Different types of decay (alpha, beta, gamma) exhibit distinct properties, governed by quantum mechanics and characterized by the concept of half-life.
