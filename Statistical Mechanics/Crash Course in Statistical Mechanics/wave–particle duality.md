Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes how every particle or quantum entity, such as photons and electrons, exhibits both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is one of the cornerstones of quantum theory, highlighting the limitations of classical concepts like "wave" and "particle" in describing quantum phenomena.

### Historical Background

1. **Light as a Wave**:
   - In the 17th and 18th centuries, light was primarily understood as a wave. Thomas Young's double-slit experiment (1801) demonstrated the interference of light, which could only be explained if light behaved as a wave.
   - James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory (1860s) further reinforced the wave nature of light, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave.

2. **Light as a Particle**:
   - In 1905, Albert Einstein proposed the concept of light quanta (later called photons) to explain the photoelectric effect, where light ejects electrons from a metal surface. This effect could not be explained by wave theory alone. Einstein suggested that light consists of discrete packets of energy (photons), exhibiting particle-like behavior.

3. **Matter Waves**:
   - In 1924, Louis de Broglie extended the concept of wave-particle duality to matter, proposing that particles such as electrons also have wave-like properties. He introduced the idea of the "matter wave" or de Broglie wavelength, given by:
     $\[
     \lambda = \frac{h}{p}
     \]$
     where $\( \lambda \)$ is the wavelength, $\( h \)$ is Planck's constant, and $\( p \)$ is the momentum of the particle.

### Key Concepts in Wave-Particle Duality

1. **Wave Nature**:
   - Particles like electrons and photons can exhibit wave-like behavior, such as diffraction and interference, typically associated with classical waves. For example:
     - **Electron Diffraction**: Electrons passing through a crystal lattice exhibit diffraction patterns similar to light waves.
     - **Double-Slit Experiment**: When particles like photons or electrons pass through two slits, they produce an interference pattern, a hallmark of wave behavior.

2. **Particle Nature**:
   - The same quantum entities also exhibit particle-like properties, such as being localized in space and time, and interacting in discrete quantities. For example:
     - **Photoelectric Effect**: Light shining on a metal surface can eject electrons in discrete packets, consistent with the particle model of photons.
     - **Compton Scattering**: When X-rays scatter off electrons, they exhibit particle-like collisions, with energy and momentum conserved as in classical particle physics.

3. **Complementarity Principle**:
   - Niels Bohr introduced the complementarity principle, which states that wave and particle aspects are complementary, meaning that the full description of quantum entities requires both aspects, but they cannot be observed simultaneously. Depending on the experimental setup, either wave-like or particle-like behavior is observed.

4. **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**:
   - The uncertainty principle is closely related to wave-particle duality. It states that certain pairs of properties, such as position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision. This principle reflects the dual nature of quantum objects, where the more precisely one property (like position) is measured, the less precisely the complementary property (like momentum) can be known.

### Experimental Evidence

1. **Double-Slit Experiment with Single Particles**:
   - When single photons or electrons are sent one at a time through a double-slit apparatus, they build up an interference pattern over time, showing wave-like behavior. However, each particle is detected as an individual event, showing particle-like behavior.

2. **Electron Diffraction**:
   - Experiments where electrons are diffracted through a crystal lattice show that even particles with mass can exhibit wave-like interference patterns, confirming de Broglie's hypothesis of matter waves.

3. **Quantum Eraser Experiments**:
   - These experiments demonstrate that the wave or particle nature of quantum entities can be influenced by whether or not "which-path" information is available. If such information is erased, the interference pattern reappears, showing the dual nature of quantum objects.

### Implications of Wave-Particle Duality

1. **Quantum Mechanics**:
   - Wave-particle duality is a foundational concept in quantum mechanics, shaping our understanding of the behavior of quantum entities. It challenges classical notions of particles and waves, leading to the development of quantum theory, where objects are described by wave functions that encode the probabilities of different outcomes.

2. **Technological Applications**:
   - Technologies such as electron microscopy, quantum computing, and various spectroscopic techniques rely on the principles of wave-particle duality.

3. **Philosophical Considerations**:
   - Wave-particle duality raises deep questions about the nature of reality, observation, and measurement. It suggests that classical concepts are insufficient to fully describe the quantum world, where objects can exhibit properties that are mutually exclusive in classical physics.

### Summary

Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, describing how quantum entities like photons and electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is central to understanding quantum phenomena and has been confirmed through numerous experiments, such as the double-slit experiment and electron diffraction. The concept challenges classical physics and has profound implications for our understanding of the nature of reality and the development of quantum theory.
