Penrose tiles are a set of non-periodic tiling patterns developed by mathematician Roger Penrose. They are famous for their ability to cover a plane without repeating patterns, a feature that distinguishes them from periodic tiling patterns. Hereâ€™s why Penrose tiles never repeat:

### Properties of Penrose Tiles

1. **Non-Periodic Tiling**:
   - **Definition**: A tiling is periodic if it repeats itself at regular intervals when extended indefinitely in the plane. Penrose tilings are non-periodic because there is no fixed translation that maps the tiling onto itself.

2. **Two Types of Penrose Tiles**:
   - **Penrose Rhombuses**: The most common set consists of two types of rhombus shapes, usually referred to as the **"kites"** and **"darts"**.
   - **Penrose Pairs**: Another set includes shapes called **"thick"** and **"thin"** Penrose triangles.

### Why Penrose Tiles Never Repeat

1. **Aperiodic Arrangement**:
   - **Matching Rules**: Penrose tilings are governed by specific matching rules that ensure that while the tiles fit together perfectly without gaps or overlaps, they do not repeat periodically. These rules control how the edges and angles of the tiles align, leading to an aperiodic arrangement.
   - **Decorative Constraints**: The tiling rules impose constraints that prevent the formation of repeating patterns. For instance, in the case of Penrose rhombuses, the tiles can only be placed according to a set of rules involving edge matching and vertex angles, which do not align in a way that would create periodicity.

2. **Self-Similarity and Scaling**:
   - **Fractal Nature**: Penrose tilings exhibit a form of self-similarity or fractal-like properties on different scales. Although they do not repeat, they possess a form of order and symmetry that can be observed at various scales.
   - **Scale Invariance**: The patterns formed by Penrose tiles can display similar structural features regardless of the scale at which you view them, contributing to their non-periodic nature.

3. **Mathematical Properties**:
   - **Quasiperiodicity**: Penrose tilings are examples of quasiperiodic tilings. Unlike periodic tilings that repeat at regular intervals, quasiperiodic tilings do not repeat but still cover the plane in a regular, predictable manner according to specific rules.
   - **Mathematical Proof**: The non-periodicity of Penrose tilings can be demonstrated mathematically. For example, it's been proven that any tiling pattern that follows the Penrose rules cannot be periodic. This is due to the constraints imposed by the angles and edge matching that prevent a regular repeating arrangement.

4. **Mathematical and Physical Models**:
   - **Aperiodic Crystals**: Penrose tilings are related to aperiodic crystals in solid-state physics. These materials exhibit long-range order without periodic repetition, similar to how Penrose tiles cover a plane without repeating patterns.
   - **Quasicrystals**: Penrose tilings are a type of mathematical model that inspired the discovery of quasicrystals in physical materials. Quasicrystals exhibit non-repeating, yet ordered structures, mirroring the properties of Penrose tilings.

### Summary

Penrose tiles never repeat because they are designed with specific matching rules that enforce non-periodicity. These rules ensure that while the tiling covers the plane without gaps or overlaps, it does so in a way that avoids periodic repetition. The mathematical properties of Penrose tilings, including their quasiperiodic nature and fractal-like self-similarity, ensure that they cannot form a repeating pattern, making them a fascinating subject of study in mathematics and art.
