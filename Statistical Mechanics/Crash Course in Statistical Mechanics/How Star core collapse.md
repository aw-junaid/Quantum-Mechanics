**Core collapse** is a critical stage in the life cycle of massive stars, leading to phenomena like supernovae and the formation of neutron stars or black holes. Here’s a detailed overview of how core collapse occurs:

### Stellar Evolution Leading to Core Collapse

1. **Stellar Lifecycle**:
   - Massive stars (those with initial masses greater than about 8 times the mass of the Sun) go through several stages of nuclear fusion during their lifetimes. They burn hydrogen into helium, then helium into heavier elements (such as carbon and oxygen), and so on, up to iron in the core.

2. **Formation of a Core**:
   - **Hydrogen Burning**: In the main sequence phase, a star fuses hydrogen into helium in its core, which produces energy and counteracts gravitational collapse.
   - **Red Giant/Supergiant Phase**: Once hydrogen in the core is exhausted, the core contracts under gravity, heating up and causing outer layers to expand. The star then burns heavier elements in shells around the core.

3. **Iron Core Formation**:
   - **Core Fusion**: In the final stages, the core may fuse elements up to iron. Iron is the end of the line for energy production through fusion because fusing iron does not release energy but rather consumes it.

### Core Collapse Mechanism

1. **Iron Core Collapse**:
   - **Core Pressure and Gravity**: When the iron core reaches a critical mass (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun, known as the Chandrasekhar limit), it can no longer support itself against gravitational collapse. This is due to the fact that iron fusion does not generate sufficient pressure to counteract gravity.
   - **Electron Degeneracy Pressure**: Initially, electron degeneracy pressure (the resistance of electrons packed into a small space) supports the core. However, once this pressure is insufficient, the core collapses.

2. **Collapse Dynamics**:
   - **Rapid Collapse**: The core collapses under its own gravity in a matter of seconds. As it shrinks, temperatures rise dramatically, and densities become extremely high.
   - **Neutronization**: In the dense core, electrons combine with protons to form neutrons and neutrinos in a process called **neutronization** (or electron capture). This process is represented by the equation:
     $\[
     e^- + p^+ \rightarrow n + \nu_e
     \]$
     where $\(e^-\)$ is an electron, $\(p^+\)$ is a proton, \(n\) is a neutron, and $\(\nu_e\)$ is an electron neutrino. The neutrinos escape the core, carrying away energy.

3. **Formation of a Neutron Star or Black Hole**:
   - **Neutron Star**: If the core mass is between approximately 1.4 to 2.16 times the mass of the Sun, the core becomes a neutron star. The collapse is halted by neutron degeneracy pressure, and the core becomes an incredibly dense object with a radius of about 10–20 kilometers.
   - **Black Hole**: If the core mass exceeds about 2.16 times the mass of the Sun, the gravitational force is so strong that it overcomes all forms of pressure, and a black hole forms. The core collapses to a singularity with infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon.

### Supernova Explosion

1. **Shock Wave Formation**:
   - **Shock Wave**: During the core collapse, the outer layers of the star fall inward and bounce off the newly formed neutron star or black hole, creating a shock wave. This shock wave travels outward, disrupting the star’s outer layers.

2. **Ejection of Outer Layers**:
   - **Supernova Explosion**: The shock wave expels the star’s outer layers into space in a violent explosion known as a supernova. This explosion disperses heavy elements into the interstellar medium, contributing to the formation of new stars and planets.

### Summary

Core collapse occurs in the final stages of a massive star's life cycle when its core can no longer support itself against gravitational forces. As the core collapses, electron degeneracy pressure gives way, leading to neutronization and the formation of a neutron star or black hole. The outer layers of the star are expelled in a supernova explosion, enriching the cosmos with heavy elements. This process plays a crucial role in the lifecycle of stars and the dynamics of galaxies.
