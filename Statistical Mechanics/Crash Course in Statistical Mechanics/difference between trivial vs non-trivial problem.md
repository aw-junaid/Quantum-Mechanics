The distinction between trivial and non-trivial problems is often used in mathematics, computer science, and other fields to classify problems based on their complexity and the effort required to solve them.

### Trivial Problems:
- **Definition**: A trivial problem is one that is straightforward and easy to solve. The solution to a trivial problem is either immediately obvious, requires very little thought or computation, or is a simple application of basic principles.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Simplicity**: The problem can be solved with minimal effort, often using basic or well-known methods.
  - **Obvious Solution**: The solution is often so clear that it requires little to no explanation.
  - **Low Complexity**: The problem does not involve complex reasoning, multiple steps, or sophisticated techniques.
- **Examples**:
  - **Basic Math**: Adding two small numbers, like \(2 + 3\).
  - **String Concatenation**: Concatenating two strings like "Hello" and "World".
  - **Data Retrieval**: Retrieving an element from an array when the index is known.

### Non-Trivial Problems:
- **Definition**: A non-trivial problem is one that is not immediately obvious or easy to solve. It typically requires deeper thought, more complex reasoning, or sophisticated techniques to find a solution.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Complexity**: The problem may involve multiple steps, require advanced knowledge, or necessitate careful analysis.
  - **Non-Obvious Solution**: The solution is not immediately apparent and might require experimentation, deduction, or the use of algorithms.
  - **Potential for Difficulty**: The problem may present challenges that require significant effort to overcome.
- **Examples**:
  - **Algorithm Design**: Developing an efficient algorithm to sort a large dataset or solve a graph problem like finding the shortest path.
  - **Mathematical Proof**: Proving a complex theorem in mathematics, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.
  - **Cryptographic Security**: Designing a cryptographic system that is resistant to various types of attacks.

### Summary:
- **Trivial Problem**: Easy to solve, solution is clear and straightforward.
- **Non-Trivial Problem**: Requires significant thought, analysis, or advanced techniques to solve.

In academic and professional discussions, when someone refers to a problem as "non-trivial," they are often highlighting that the problem requires serious consideration and cannot be dismissed as simple or easy. Conversely, labeling a problem as "trivial" suggests that it does not pose a significant challenge.
