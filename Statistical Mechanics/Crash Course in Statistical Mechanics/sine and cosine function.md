The sine and cosine functions are fundamental trigonometric functions that describe the relationships between the angles and sides of right-angled triangles. They are also periodic functions that are widely used in mathematics, physics, engineering, and many other fields.

### Definitions

1. **Sine Function**:
   - The sine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - In the unit circle, $\(\sin(\theta)\)$ is the y-coordinate of the point on the circle corresponding to the angle $\(\theta\)$.

2. **Cosine Function**:
   - The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.
   - In the unit circle, $\(\cos(\theta)\)$ is the x-coordinate of the point on the circle corresponding to the angle $\(\theta\)$.

### Mathematical Formulas

1. **Sine Function**:
   $\[
   \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
   \]$
   - In the unit circle: $\(\sin(\theta) = y\)$

2. **Cosine Function**:
   $\[
   \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
   \]$
   - In the unit circle: $\(\cos(\theta) = x\)$

### Properties

1. **Periodicity**:
   - Both sine and cosine functions are periodic with a period of $\(2\pi\)$ radians or 360 degrees.
   - This means $\(\sin(\theta + 2\pi) = \sin(\theta)\)$ and $\(\cos(\theta + 2\pi) = \cos(\theta)\)$.

2. **Amplitude**:
   - The range of both functions is between -1 and 1. The maximum value of $\(\sin(\theta)\)$ and $\(\cos(\theta)\)$ is 1, and the minimum value is -1.

3. **Frequency**:
   - The frequency of the sine and cosine functions is the reciprocal of the period. For a standard sine or cosine function, the frequency is $\( \frac{1}{2\pi} \)$.

4. **Phase Shift**:
   - The functions can be shifted horizontally. For example, $\(\sin(\theta - \phi)\)$ and $\(\cos(\theta - \phi)\)$ represent a phase shift by $\(\phi\)$.

5. **Symmetry**:
   - The sine function is an odd function: $\(\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)\)$.
   - The cosine function is an even function: $\(\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)\)$.

### Graphs

1. **Sine Function Graph**:
   - Starts at \((0,0)\), reaches a maximum of 1 at $\(\pi/2\)$, returns to 0 at $\(\pi\)$, reaches a minimum of -1 at $\(3\pi/2\)$, and completes the cycle at $\(2\pi\)$.
   - The graph is sinusoidal and oscillates between -1 and 1.

2. **Cosine Function Graph**:
   - Starts at $\((0,1)\)$, decreases to -1 at $\(\pi\)$, returns to 1 at $\(2\pi\)$.
   - The graph is also sinusoidal and oscillates between -1 and 1, but it is shifted to the left by $\(\pi/2\)$ compared to the sine function.

### Trigonometric Identities

1. **Pythagorean Identity**:
   $\[
   \sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1
   \]$

2. **Angle Sum and Difference Identities**:
   $\[
   \sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
   \]$
   $\[
   \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
   \]$

3. **Double-Angle Identities**:
   $\[
   \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)
   \]$
   $\[
   \cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta)
   \]$

### Applications

1. **Physics**:
   - Sine and cosine functions model periodic phenomena such as oscillations, sound waves, and alternating current.

2. **Engineering**:
   - They are used in signal processing, electrical engineering, and control systems to analyze and design systems with periodic inputs.

3. **Computer Graphics**:
   - In graphics, they are used to compute angles, rotations, and oscillations for rendering and simulations.

4. **Mathematics**:
   - They are essential in solving differential equations, Fourier analysis, and many other areas of mathematical analysis.

### Summary

The sine and cosine functions are fundamental trigonometric functions that describe the relationship between angles and sides in right-angled triangles and model periodic phenomena in various applications. They have distinct properties, periodicity, and symmetrical behaviors that make them crucial in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
